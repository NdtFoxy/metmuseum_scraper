        "Intro Description": "The two paintings above depicting the biblical story of the temptation of Eve were probably made to be set within the wall paneling of a Florentine bedroom. Eve takes fruit from the forbidden tree of knowledge and passes it to Adam, disobeying God’s orders. He gives in to the temptations of a serpent with a head that resembles Eve’s, a device used in Christian art to emphasize their similarities as sinful seducers. Bugiardini painted several comparable oblong nude figures for similar settings, but more typically the figures are taken from classical history or myth.",

        "Catalogue Entry": "Dauzats visited Giza between May 11 and early June, 1830. This striking view of the twenty-sixth century B.C. Great Pyramid, or Pyramid of Cheops, is depicted from a position near a corner of its base. The dramatic perspective reflects Dauzats’s early training as a theatrical painter. The monument fills nearly the entire composition and is truncated at the sides, emphasizing its powerful form and exceptional height. Figures in local dress scramble over the pyramid, further enhancing its scale. The time of day must be morning, as only the left face is illuminated by direct sunlight, while the moon remains faintly visible behind a lightly vaporous sky. Two raptors soar nearby.Given its sketchlike quality it is tempting to suppose that Dauzats painted the picture before the motif, but he is more likely to have done so after his return to France in the fall of 1830, perhaps at the same time that he was preparing for his debut at the Salon of 1831. There he showed two related subjects, a painting,Al-Azhar Mosque, Cairo(Assemblée Nationale, Paris), and a drawing,Turkish Café in Alexandria(whereabouts unknown). The present work is signed with the artist’s initials in a form that he used for a short period about 1830 (see Plessier 1990), yet its early history remains untraced, and it was unknown to scholars until it surfaced on the Paris art market in 1983.Dauzats had traveled to Egypt as part of the entourage of arts impresario baron Isidore Taylor (1789–1879), who led a diplomatic mission to negotiate with Egypt’s ruler, Muhammad Ali (1769–1849), for the acquisition of the obelisks that then stood as a pair at the entrance to the Temple of Luxor; one of them would be installed at the center of the Place de la Concorde in Paris in October 1836. (For a view of the gate to the Temple of Luxor with its sole remaining obelisk painted in the same month, see the oil sketch by Antoine-Xavier-Gabriel de Gazeau, comte de La Bouëre,2003.42.37). Dauzats and contemporaries who undertook similar journeys about the same time, including Alexandre-Gabriel Decamps (Turkey, 1828), Prosper Marilhat (Egypt, 1831–32), and Eugène Delacroix (Morocco and Algeria, 1832), are generally credited with elevating Orientalist subjects as a popular genre, one that served as a filter through which Europeans visualized and indeed conceptualized the Muslim world for much of the nineteenth century.Dauzats later published an account of his travels in Egypt that includes a description of his ascent of the Great Pyramid with another traveling companion, the painter Étienne-François-Auguste Mayer (1805–1890): \"The largest of the pyramids, the preferred one to climb, rests on a base six hundred ninety-nine feet long [sic], and appears, from below, slightly indented at the summit. Formed of stacked stones that project and recede, it looks like a gigantic staircase, each step of which is four feet high and ten inches wide. At first the ascent seemed to us, if not impossible, then at least moderately awkward to accomplish; but [our guide] Mohammed attacked it at an angle, stepping over the first block, grabbing the second, and, beckoning us to follow him, continued on his way as if inviting us to do the simplest thing. It was not much fun to climb four hundred twenty-one feet [sic] under such strong sun, which was also reflected by the stone that we climbed like lizards, and we were not in the least bit ashamed to follow well behind. [. . .] Finally, after twenty minutes of hard labor, and after having sufficiently bent back our fingrnails and skinned our knees, we reached the summit; but almost as soon as we did, we had to think about getting back down, lest the sun of Egypt melt away what little fat was left on our bones. Yet I did have time to take in the entire landscape at my leisure. [. . .] We walked around the pyramid to seek some shade. Unfortunately the sun was at its zenith, so it shone on the four sides of the tomb of Cheops. We walked all the way around it without finding a place where one could remain for more than five minutes without going crazy.\" (Dauzats, with Alexandre Dumas,Impressions de Voyage: Quinze jours au Sinaï, Paris, 1839 [Brussels ed., 1839, pp. 146–47]; and see Dauzats’s 1846 letter on the subject of this text in Marionneau, \"Dauzats. [1846.] Les Pyramides et le Sphinx de Gizeh,\"Nouvelles archives de l’art français, 3e sér., vol. 4, 1888, pp. 220–23).Asher Ethan Miller 2015",
        "Technical Notes": "The painting is in very good condition. In preparation for painting, the canvas was primed with a white ground, which was left to show as the lightest parts of the stone blocks at the top of the pyramid. The painting was boldly worked, with strokes of impasto for the stone faces in full sunlight and the robes of the men climbing. The fine canvas may have originally been pinned to a board for painting, as holes are present in the corners and in the centers of the sides, and there are creases consistent with an unsupported canvas. The canvas was probably lined and stretched on its present stretcher early on.Charlotte Hale 2015",

        "Catalogue Entry": "The Artist:Born about 1509, Jan Massys was the first child of the famous Antwerp painter Quinten Massys and his wife, Catharina Heyns. Probably trained in his father’s workshop, Jan and his younger brother Cornelis both joined the Guild of Saint Luke in Antwerp in 1531—that is, the year after their father’s death. Jan married Anna van Thuylt around 1538, and they had four children, including Quinten the younger, who also became a painter.Jan lived in turbulent times in Antwerp, which became the center of Reformation uprisings. Having been identified with links to the Loïsts, a libertine sect, Jan, his brother Cornelis, and fourteen others were accused of heresy on November 10, 1544, and were exiled from Brabant. Jan left his family and fled to Italy, probably to Genoa, and perhaps spent some years near Fontainbleau, as later stylistic characteristics of his work suggest. Massys’s petition to the Council of Brabant to allow his return to Antwerp in 1551 was unsuccessful, but a second attempt in 1554 was approved. By the end of 1555, Jan had returned home to his family. In subsequent years, he was relatively successful in his métier, especially between 1559–68. He took on three apprentices— Frans van Thuylt (in 1536), Frans de Witte (in 1543), and Olivier de Cuyper (in 1569)—who are known today only by name but not by any identifiable works. A fourth apprentice was enrolled anonymously in the Liggeren in 1567 (as “Eenen by Jan Quinten, schilder”).[1] Jan died in 1573.Although mentioned by the contemporary artist biographers Guicciardini (1567) and Vasari (1568), Jan remained in the shadow of his more famous father. However, Karel Van Mander (1604) admitted that Jan “too was a great painter.” Max J. Friedländer (1936) and Leo van Puyvelde (1962) devoted early studies to Jan Massys, and Luis Reis-Santos (1964) attempted to differentiate the works of Jan and Quinten.[2] Leontine Buijnsters-Smets’s monograph (1995) starts with Jan’s earliest dated work, aSaint Jeromeof 1537 (Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna), and builds the oeuvre backward and forward from that point.[3] Jan’s youthful works predictably depend upon his father’s compositions, from which he produced copies. Jan’s 1552Virgin and Child(Palazzo Bianco, Genoa) and the 1552Nativity(private collection; sale, Sotheby’s, London, July 4, 2013, no. 105) are the only signed and dated works from his years in exile. But from this starting point others can be assembled that show the influences of Leonardo da Vinci’s followers (as in the Genoa, Palazzo Bianco Virgin and Child) and the newly developing mannerist style (as in Jan’sCaritas, also at the Palazzo Bianco). Later works reveal the influence of the Fontainbleau school, such as hisJudith and Holofernes(Koninklijk Museum voor Schone Kunsten, Antwerp) orDavid and Bathshebaof 1562 (Musée du Louvre, Paris). Finally, Jan further developed his father Quinten’s interest in satirical paintings by producing several versions of unequal lovers and merry company scenes. The most recent catalogue raisonné of Jan Massys’s works is by Leontine Buijnsters-Smets (1995) and should be consulted for further details of the artist’s life and works.The Painting: This imposing painting masterfully demonstrates advances in the development of new genres of painting in the 1530s in Antwerp. Increased attention paid to landscape art, still-life painting, and figural motifs derived from the works of Leonardo da Vinci and his followers were already in their incipient stages in works by Joos van Cleve, such as theVirgin and Child(The Met,1982.60.47) or theVirgin and Child with the Cherries(formerly Hester Diamond Collection, New York), and by Quinten Massys’sVirgin and Child with the Cherries(Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam, and Mauritshuis, The Hague), all of about 1525–30 (see figs. 1–2 above). In theRest on the Flight, the dominance of the large-scale figures in the composition, the abundance of grapes and apples at the lower right, and the extensive landscape setting are individually so prominent that they strain the cohesion of the painting. It is only upon close inspection that one may identify certain details in the background—Herod’s troops advancing between the rocky masses at the upper left to seek out and kill the Christ Child, and Joseph filling his water jug from a stream at center right—that indicate the overall theme of the Rest on the Flight into Egypt.The Flight into Egypt is briefly recounted in the Gospel of Saint Matthew (2:13), but the Rest on the Flight is only discussed in apocryphal accounts such as the Gospel of the Pseudo-Matthew and  theGolden Legendof Jacobus da Voragine. The latter relates how the Holy Family stopped to rest on the third day of their travels, leading to early miracles of the Christ Child, who caused a spring of water to appear to quench the thirst of the family. The still life of grapes and apples is not without symbolic meaning. While providing sustenance for the Holy Family, the two large bunches of grapes also refer to the Eucharist and to Christ’s sacrifice on the cross for humankind. The apples, likewise, recall the fall of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden through Eve's offering to Adam of the forbidden fruit. Here this fruit signals the promise of forgiveness of sins through Jesus Christ and references Mary as the new Eve, just as Christ is the new Adam.The Attribution:This painting relates stylistically to a group of Virgin and Child images that were executed in Quinten Massys’s workshop in the 1520s, during the late years of the master’s activity (see Refs.). As Larry Silver has pointed out, after having exploited models coming from the early Netherlandish tradition (from Robert Campin and Rogier van der Weyden, to Dieric Bouts and Hans Memling), Quinten reconsidered his sources, looking at the very popular Virgin and Child paintings produced by his younger colleague Joos van Cleve.[4] Both painters appear to have been deeply indebted to Leonardo da Vinci, the compositions of which were known through networks that are not yet clear. Quinten’s change is particularly evident in paintings such as the lostMadonna of the Cherries, the BerlinButter Madonna, and the Rattier Madonna at the Louvre, each of which were replicated several times by the workshop.[5]At this time, Quinten developed a new interest in the naturalistic depiction of intimacy and the human qualities of the Virgin and Child. Furthermore, he updated his compositions to favor representations of everyday life where the symbolic fruits became informal still-life elements, and the landscape assumed a greater importance. It is probably not by chance that this interesting shift developed when Quinten’s son Jan began to collaborate with his father. Perhaps more than his father, Jan was eager to embrace new trends and market demands. He completed his apprenticeship in his father’s workshop and likely began to collaborate with him, with increasing responsibility from around 1526. Unfortunately, we have no paintings by Jan that can be dated with certainty to this period. Therefore, his earliest achievements must be traced through the identification of those workshop paintings that present the stylistic features recognizable later on in his mature oeuvre.Attempting to characterize Jan’s initial steps in the shadows of Quinten, Luis Reis-Santos and Villy Scaff discussed the possibility that some of Quinten’s paintings were executed in collaboration with Jan, or were finished by Jan, or that copies of Quinten’s prototypes were produced by Jan after 1530 in order to perpetuate his father’s legacy.[6] Leontine Buijnsters-Smets attributed to Jan himself the two copies of theRattier Madonna(both in private collections).[7] Based on technical and stylistic comparisons, Maria Clelia Galassi proposed Jan as the painter of theVirgin and Childin the Musées Royaux des Beaux-Arts, Brussels, which is derived from Quinten’sButter Madonna.[8]Prominent characteristics of Jan’s style that separate his works from those of Quinten include a somewhat less convincing rendering of chiaroscuro, and a predominance of pink and enamel-like flesh tones, with the modelling of the hands appearing particularly flat. There is a different approach to rendering space in which the horizon line is elevated in order to provide a more extensive background setting. In addition, Jan’s figures are consistently projected forward, closer to the viewer. Their draperies are broadly painted and the poses are somewhat repetitive. All these features are found in The Met’sRest of the Flight into Egyptthat may be attributed, insofar as the figures are concerned, to Jan at the end of the 1530s or the beginning of the 1540s, after he had become a free master.[9] This attribution to Jan was also mentioned briefly in the early literature (see Loo 1902 and Burroughs and Weale 1932). Stylistic affinities can be found with theMadonnain Brussels (Musées Royaux des Beaux-Arts) and with theMadonnain Antwerp’s Sint Jacobskerk of around 1535 (figs. 3, 4). Also close in terms of the rendering of the heads of the Virgin and Child is theHoly Family with Elizabeth and Saint John the Baptist(Carnegie Museum of Art, Pittsburgh; fig. 5) of the 1530s, and the head of Susanna inSusanna and the Elders(ca. 1530s, Phoebus Foundation, Antwerp; figs. 6, 7).[10]All visual evidence points to the fact that while Jan painted the figures in The Met's panel, a collaborator painted the landscape background. As is the case with other examples in The Met’s collection, namely Joos van Cleve’sCrucifixion with Saints and a Donorof about 1520 (41.190.20a–c) and Virgin and Child of about 1525 (1982.60.47), the x-radiograph (fig. 8) shows that the brushwork of the landscape carefully circumnavigates the contours of the figures. The painting of the figures and the landscape does not overlap at the edges of forms, thereby indicating two different stages of work by two separate artists. Walter Gibson (1989) identified this landscape painter as the Master of the Lille Sermon, while Luc Serck (1990) renamed the specialist as the Master of the Liège Disciples at Emmaus (Netherlandish, active mid-16th century), based on the close similarity of the landscape in theRest on the Flightwith that found in the background of theRoad to Emmaus(Musée d’Art Religieux et d’Art Mosan, Liège).[11]Bolstering the attribution of The Met’s panel to Jan Massys is further information from the technical examination of the painting in comparison with other paintings studied by Maria Clelia Galassi.[12] The underdrawing is scarcely visible with infrared reflectography, only appearing along some contours (fig. 9). It establishes the outlines of the faces, the Child’s body, and the Madonna’s hands, by means of a liquid medium, perhaps based on a very fine preliminary sketch in a dry medium. Some shifting in the position of the Child’s legs and the Virgin’s proper right hand were made during the paint stage. This type of underdrawing (purely linear, executed by brush over the possible first sketch in a dry medium), as well as the tendency to shift details such as hands and feet, is consistent with what has been observed by Galassi in her technical study of the works of Jan Massys. Infrared reflectography also shows a technical detail that can be found in Jan’s works and that seems to be quite characteristic of his painting technique from early on. This is his particular way of blending the dark lines of the draperies (see the Virgin’s robe) through short hatching, achieved by rubbing the brush on the still-wet color. A similar wet-in-wet treatment can be seen in the earlyTax Collectorof 1539 (Gemäldegaerie, Dresden) and the 1552Madonna and Childin Genoa, as well as in later works such asLot and his Daughters(1563; Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna).Both the x-radiograph and the infrared reflectogram (figs. 8, 9) show significant changes in the Virgin's head covering and dress. Initially, Massys conceived of the Virgin as an elegantly dressed lady, with a refined turban and the white fabric of her undergarment coming through her decoratively slit left sleeve. These elements of luxurious fashion were then revised during a later painting stage: the turban was transformed into a thin, modest veil, and the design of her sleeve was simplified. Examination with a high-powered binocular microscope, followed by cross-section analysis (see Technical Notes) revealed that the color of the Virgin’s sleeve as well as her dress also was altered from red to blue. Furthermore, this analysis indicated that the changes took place over a UV-fluorescing resinous layer, possibly a layer of varnish, suggesting that some time had passed between the initial completion of the painting and the second intervention. This is confirmed as well by the fact that the upper blue paint layer flowed into the already aged drying cracks of the red paint below. We can only guess the reasons for the alterations in the style and color of the Virgin’s costume. This choice of austerity also involved the addition of golden halo rays around the heads—in the case of the Virgin, in a particular form of alternating wavy and straight golden rays that one finds in Spanish paintings of the period. This could have been a sort of \"censorship\" introduced to an image considered too frivolous by a subsequent owner particularly respectful of the rules of Catholic doctrine. The changes may well have taken place when the painting was exported to Spain where a more conservative taste existed. If so, then this possibility would link the picture with its earliest known Spanish provenance.The motif of the Virgin and Child was introduced into a different landscape in a slightly smaller painting by a follower of Jan Massys in the Collection of Brita Marcus (Stockholm, Sweden). This suggests that drawings of popular motifs and patterns or cartoons for their transfer were readily available in Massys’s workshop and were perhaps more widely circulated. Evidence of this is found in The Met’s painting as well where infrared reflectography revealed a possible grid system used to transfer a smaller-scale design of the motif of the Virgin and Child to the large panel (see Technical Notes). Furthermore, a stencil or cartoon may have been used for the clusters of grapes. Such details of working procedure provide clues to Massys’s efforts to employ methods that would facilitate the efficient production of popular compositions for both private clients and open market sales.Maryan W.

An earliest felling date can be derived for the year 1517, with a more plausible felling date of 1521..1523….1527 +x. With a minimum of two years for seasoning an earliest creation of the painting is possible from 1519 upward. With a median of fifteen sapwood rings and two years for seasoning a creation is plausible from 1525 upward.[10] For a long time scholars believed theSusanna and the Eldersnow in the Phoebus Foundation collection was dated 1556. In reality, the date is partially erased and we can only read clearly the first number, a 1. Maria Galassi personally examined the painting and now dates it to around 1537–40.[11] Giorgio Faggin first called the landscape artist the Master of the Lille Sermon inLa Pitura ad Anversa nel cinquecento, Florence, 1968, p. 41 n. 34. The same landscape painter seems to have painted the background in anotherRest on the Flight into Egypt(Paris art market J. Lupu, 1990; European Paintings archive files). See Serck 1990, pp. 1183–1240, for the group of paintings that he associates with this landscape specialist.[12] Galassi’s study is in preparation for a book to be published by Brepols, Turnhout, entitledJan Massys (c.1510–1573): A Renaissance Painter of the Flemish Beauty.",
        "Technical Notes": "Support:The support is a vertically-grained wood panel made from three unequally-sized pieces of oak measuring, left to right, 23.8cm, 30cm and 23cm (9 3/8, 11 3/4 and 9 1/16 in) wide. The wood originated in the Baltic/Polish regions. Dendrochronological analysis indicated an earliest possible creation date of 1519 with a more plausible date of 1525 onwards.[1]X-radiography revealed that each join is spanned by four equally distributed butterfly inserts, apparently original (see fig. 8 above). Partial butterfly inserts can also be seen around the perimeter of the painting, two on each lateral side and three each on the top and bottom. These partial butterfly joins may be remnants of a method for attaching an original framing device. Similar butterfly remnants were found on a painting associated with Cornelius Massys,Magdalen, (Musée du Louvre, Paris) which interestingly also displays changes to the headdress (see Preparation and Paint Layers below).[2]Although no barbe is extant on the painting, the dimensions of the panel seem to be close to original. Evenly spaced underdrawn marks around the perimeter of the panel (see Preparation below) would likely have been trimmed away if the panel had been cut down any significant degree. Prior to entering The Met’s collection the panel was thinned and cradled.Preparation:Based on close inspection with a high-powered binocular microscope and microscopic examination of cross-sections, it appears the panel was prepared with a whitish ground (presumably a chalk-glue ground) and a very thin, lightly pink-tinted, reflective overall priming layer.Examination with infrared reflectography (IRR) revealed only a few light and fine potential underdrawn lines at contours; however, several noteworthy changes were plainly visible (see fig. 9).[3] Comparison of the reflectogram with an x-radiograph, combined with close examination of the painting, was indispensable in comprehending the changes. Significant alterations were made to Mary’s costume. Initially, the artist depicted Mary wearing a turban, but this was then replaced with a diaphanous veil and a radiating gold halo that necessitated covering the turban with the blue of the sky. On Mary’s proper left arm a fuller slashed sleeve, complete with blousing pulled through the slits, was replaced with a sleeve that is tight below the elbow, a modification that required the addition of negative space between her arm and lap. These changes are more fully elucidated by study of the paint layers (see Paint Layers below).Strongly geometric shadows and dots in the center of each grape, made visible with IRR, suggest the possible use of a stencil or a cartoon for creating the grape clusters. The portion of the landscape on the right side of the painting shows only a vague indication of the horizon with IRR, but no further details of the landscape. IRR does, however, reveal that the tree was painted directly over the rocky outcropping behind it.Examination with infrared also revealed equally spaced dots around the perimeter of the panel, which may indicate that a grid was used to transfer a smaller version of the composition. No actual grid lines were visible in the reflectogram, suggesting a complete grid was not required, eliminated at a later stage, or executed in a medium not made visible through IRR.Paint Layers:Overall the painting is in good condition.As described above, alterations were made to Mary’s costume, both in style and color. For example, when the slashed sleeve was altered to reflect a different, possibly more Southern European style of clothing, the color was altered as well. Close inspection of the passage with a high-powered binocular microscope revealed a thick blue paint covering a lower layer of red paint. The coarsely-ground blue paint can be seen flowing into the cracks of the red paint below, indicating the change was made long enough after the completion of the painting that the original paint layer had time to develop age-related drying cracks.  This was confirmed by cross-section analysis, which also revealed the presence of a UV-fluorescing resinous layer, possibly a layer of varnish, between the uppermost blue and red paint layers. The remainder of Mary’s dress, although not altered stylistically, appears to have been changed from red to blue as well.The color of the cloth draped across Mary’s lap was also altered. The artist began with a paint primarily composed of blue pigment with an addition of red lake, followed by a thinly applied but densely pigmented red paint (possibly an opaque red mixed with a lake). A subsequent thick resinous layer, which fluoresces brightly under UV, may be a varnish layer. The present purple color, which rests atop the resinous layer, was created with a mixture of a coarsely-ground blue pigment and red lake.Mary’s original head turban may have been a green-red changeant fabric based on examination with a high-powered binocular microscope and cross-section analysis. The entire turban was painted out with light blue paint to match the surrounding sky. A modest gauzy veil replaced the turban, and a halo of radiating lines, both straight and wavy, was added. A halo was also added around the Christ Child’s head where it extends over the later dark blue version of Mary’s mantle. These changes to Mary’s headdress and costume were all carried out some time after the painting was completed, perhaps to suit a later owner (see Catalogue Entry).The flesh tones were created with smoothly blended opaque paints. Dark shadows and facial contours (nostrils, the edges of the eyes) were emphasized with strokes of a transparent dark brown paint. Touches of red lake were applied between the lips and in the corners of the eyes.The landscape in this painting was executed at a high level of quality and displays a lovely sense of atmospheric perspective. As revealed in the IRR, the right-most tree was painted after the rock and sky were completed, suggesting the tree was a compositional element added at a late stage and perhaps not originally planned.Karen Thomas 2010; adapted for the website by Sophie Scully 2020[1] Wood identification and dendrochronological analysis completed by Dr. Peter Klein, Universität Hamburg, report dated May 30, 2014. The report can be found in the files of the Department of Paintings Conservation. “The youngest heartwood ring was formed out in the year 1508. Regarding the sapwood statistic of Eastern Europe an earliest felling date can be derived for the year 1517, more plausible is a felling date between 1521..1523….1527 +x. With a minimum of 2 years for seasoning an earliest creation of the painting is possible from 1519 upwards. Under the assumption of a median of 15 sapwood rings and 2 years for seasoning, as probably usual in the 14th/15th century, a creation is plausible from 1525 upwards.”[2] Verbal communication with Cécile Scaillerez, Musee du Louvre, Paris, 2010.[3] Infrared reflectography completed with a Merlin Indigo InGaAs near-infrared camera with a StingRay macro lens customized for the wavelengths covered by the camera, 0.9 to 1.7 microns, May 2010.",

        "Catalogue Entry": "The Artist and Attribution of the Painting:This painting has historically been attributed to Pieter Huys (active by 1545–died 1584). Like his brother Frans Huys (1522–1562) (The Met1996.230), Pieter Huys worked as an engraver and print designer, but the scholarly consensus is that he was primarily a painter who had success creating Boschian scenes. The attribution of The Met's painting to Huys, first suggested by Edouard Michel (1935) based on a photograph, was subsequently adopted by the Museum and by other authors, including Leo van Puyvelde (1962 and 1971). Gerd Unverfehrt (1980) placed The Met's painting as a copy in the Mandyn-Huys Group, given that Pieter Huys’s paintings are often confused with the Boschian productions of his contemporary Jan Mandyn (ca. 1500–ca. 1559). Of four extant paintings that bear Huys’s signature, three are Boschian in subject matter but vary considerably in date and painting style (Musée du Louvre, Paris; Museum Mayer van den Bergh, Antwerp; and Museo Nacional del Prado, Madrid). While the attribution to Pieter Huys is plausible for The Met's painting and for other unsigned versions of the composition, the clearly successful theme indicates the output of a large workshop or of multiple workshops. Until a comprehensive technical study is undertaken of the four signed paintings and of the larger group of related works, any attributions to the artist—as well as any assessments of the order of the versions—must remain preliminary.The Painting:Saint Anthony, identifiable by the attribute of a pig and by the Tau cross on his shoulder (now abraded), introduces the chaotic scene of his temptation like an orator or an actor on a stage. The landscape, rendered in light green and lavender-gray tones, is populated by objects of daily life, reconfigured into arrangements at once playful and ghoulish. In the foreground, a fox passes by wearing a nun’s habit. In the background, a fish flies through the air, and broken jugs form a city in flames. Saint Anthony is surrounded, but remains untouched. It is unclear, perhaps intentionally, whether the saint’s pointing gesture represents his initial weakness to temptation or his final renunciation.The nude temptress at center represents the demon disguised as a queen who appears in some accounts of Saint Anthony’s life, although not in theGolden Legendtelling. Beside her, an old woman brandishes a spindle and a female creature in an exotic headdress offers a calf’s head on a plate, a traditional carnival dish (Larry Silver,Peasant Scenes and Landscapes: The Rise of Pictorial Genres in the Antwerp Art Market, Philadelphia, 2006, p. 135). The burning city in the background and the disembodied leg, which dangles like an ex-voto from a dead tree in the upper center, may be references to ergotism or Saint Anthony’s Fire, a widespread and deadly disease of the period with symptoms that included hallucinations and gangrene (see The Metropolitan Museum of ArtHeilbrunn Timeline of Art History, \"Medicine in the Middle Ages\"). Because the sick were treated by local Antonite monks, the epidemic of Saint Anthony’s Fire may help explain the ubiquity of paintings of Saint Anthony—and especially of his disturbing, fiery visions—in Antwerp during this period (Corwin 1976).The Subject and Function:The composition, which exists in several versions and variations, is indebted to the work of Hieronymus Bosch (ca. 1450–1516). Boschian paintings and prints of hermit saints and hell landscapes remained extraordinarily popular in Antwerp from Bosch’s death through the beginning of the seventeenth century (see also The Met26.244). The discrete creature types (skeletal animals, winged amphibians, and the foolish owl) found in The Met's painting have a precedent in paintings by Bosch such as the Lisbon triptych of the same theme (Museu Nacional de Arte Antiga). However, the Museum’s work is a pastiche in a Boschian idiom, with motifs transformed to fit a later aesthetic. Bosch’s influence on The Met's painting is likely indirect, through the productions of other sixteenth-century Bosch followers, including Hieronymus Cock’s engravings after Pieter Bruegel the Elder (ca. 1525–1569) (see especially The Met28.4[13]). The innovation of placing Saint Anthony, seated, at the edge of the composition does not appear until the middle of the sixteenth century (Corwin 1976).At least three other known paintings are extremely close to The Met's panel in composition and dimensions (Erasmushouse Museum, Brussels; see fig. 1 above); Sotheby’s, New York, June 6, 2013; Collection Paprocki, 1963, Sint-Genesius-Rode/Ex. Collection Schoen, Amsterdam). In turn, these exact repetitions share compositional overlap with a larger group of Boschian paintings of the temptation of Saint Anthony, all made in Antwerp in the middle of the sixteenth century. This broader group includes two paintings, one in Brussels (Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium) and one in Madrid (Real Monasterio de San Lorenzo de El Escorial), where the figure of Saint Anthony—but not the figure of the nude woman—is reversed from the orientation in The Met's painting. Selective changes such as this indicate the use of drawn workshop models for individual figures, which painters within a workshop could rearrange and even flip in planning a new painting. During this period, Antwerp workshops began to sell finished panels and canvases made on speculation, and paintings were exported to other regions, especially to Italy and Spain. Workshops adapted their practices to match this new demand. The technical examination of the surface of The Met's painting supports the idea that it was made using time-saving workshop techniques, but by a talented and confident artist.The large size and relative legibility of this painting make it possible that it could have been intended for a local Antonite hospital and hung in view of the patients to encourage contemplation of sin and salvation. The removal of overpaint during the cleaning and restoration of the painting has revealed apparently deliberate scratches across the nude woman’s eyes and crotch—evidence, perhaps, of an attack by a pious individual on the worldly allure of the figure. These intentional marks suggest that the painting was taken seriously in its time as a religious work, even as Boschian paintings and prints of the theme were simultaneously marketed for entertainment as well as instruction.Anna-Claire Stinebring 2015",
        "Technical Notes": "Support:The support was constructed from four planks of oak with the grain oriented horizontally. Dendrochronological analysis indicated an earliest possible creation date of 1552, with a more plausible date of 1558 onwards.[1] The wood originated in the Baltic/Polish region. The original dimensions of the support are preserved, however, the support has undergone considerable structural interventions over its history.The planks were originally butt-joined and held in place with wooden dowels, the voids of which can be seen in the x-radiograph and on the reverse of the now thinned panel (see fig. 2 above). At some point, the four planks were taken apart, likely to make repairs after significant structural damage. They were then rejoined with a significant step along the uppermost planks. In order to level out this step, the painted surface was shaved down; this drastic intervention removed a strip of paint, ground and wood along the right third of the uppermost join, almost an inch wide at the widest point. The planks were rejoined using butterfly inserts, the reverse was planed and a cradle attached. Fortunately, the original back of the panel was not entirely removed. Panels, often not perfectly flat on the reverse, were frequently planed down during structural interventions to create a flat surface to adhere a cradle to. But in this case, only the thickest parts of the panel were planed and the thinnest—in the upper right quadrant of the reverse—were not touched, leaving areas of the original reverse intact and, fortunately, the remains of a woodsman’s mark (figs. 3, 4).[2] The panel now measures 5/16 inch (8 mm) at its thickest point.  At some point prior to cradling, triangular wood inserts were added to the lower corners, likely to compensate for damages there.During a 2015 treatment at The Met, the cradle was removed, the planks were separated and rejoined at their proper surface level, and a secondary strainer with spring mechanisms was attached to the back.Preparation:The panel was prepared with a white ground. There is a light purplish-grey priming layer on top of this white ground. Examination with infrared reflectography did not reveal the presence of any underdrawing.[3] However, given the size and complexity of the composition, it does seem likely that the design would have been laid out on the panel prior to painting. It is possible that an underdrawing is present but is now obscured in infrared examination by the colored priming layer.The original panel was prepared and painted before a frame was installed. There are ridges of paint about 3/8 inch in from the right and left edge where the still-wet paint was disturbed, possibly made by a channel edge support. Such devices were more often installed before painting began, but perhaps, in this case, one was applied during the course of painting.Paint Layers:The artist painted this composition using a straightforward, often economic, technique. He applied his paint in few layers, frequently blending paint with wet-in-wet brushstrokes. The sweeping, fantastical cloud formations are a wonderful example of this: the artist heightened the sense of a bright sky peeking behind the advancing clouds by dragging the deepest grey paint across the still-wet lightest paint. He generally painted with broad brushstrokes but added fine details to great effect, particularly in the colorful tendrils and feathers of the creatures at lower left and right.The purple-grey priming layer would have helped speed the painting process by providing a cool mid-tone upon which to build his form, instead of a stark white ground. This would have been particularly helpful in the many dark passages. The artist made occasional use of reserves during the painting process, such as for the temptress and Saint Anthony, but also added many of the small figures on top of the landscape.The artist introduced few changes to his composition during the course of painting. Most changes were simple corrections to contours, but he did make a significant alteration to the temptress at center, lowering her right arm and shoulder and slightly narrowing her limbs, as can be seen in the x-radiograph (fig. 5). The initial position of the temptress is remarkably close to the one in theTemptation of Saint Anthonyin the Erasmushouse, Brussels: the closest in composition to The Met painting of the many examples of this scene linked with Peter Huys (fig.1; see Catalogue Entry). While clear differences in technique and style between the two paintings indicate different hands, the compositions are remarkably close and the dimensions are nearly the same—the Brussels panel measures 117 x 146 cm—suggesting that the two paintings had a shared model.The painting has suffered extensive damage, much of which is associated with structural issues including widespread flaking from the movement of the wood panel and losses along the joins and splits. In addition, the uppermost glazes are abraded, especially in the brown passages. Scratches, which were apparently intentional, have also disfigured the temptress’s eyes and pudendum. The recent restoration, completed in 2018, reintegrated such damages with selective and reversible retouching.Much of the water in the lower right quadrant of the composition was overpainted earlier in its history as an expedient way of compensating for widespread losses. This overpainting, which has been left in place, was carried out using a dark blue oil paint that did not imitate the gradation of light and the reflection of figures in the water.Sophie Scully 2019[1] Wood identification and dendrochronological analysis completed by Dr. Peter Klein, Universität Hamburg, report dated May 5, 2015. The report can be found in the files of the Department of Paintings Conservation. “The youngest heartwood ring was formed out in the year 1541. Regarding the sapwood statistic of Eastern Europe an earliest felling date can be derived for the year 1550, more plausible is a felling date between 1554..1556….1560 +x. With a minimum of 2 years for seasoning an earliest creation of the painting is possible from 1552 upwards. Under the assumption of a median of 15 sapwood rings and 2 years for seasoning a creation is plausible from 1558 upwards.”[2] Marks such as this were added to timber directly after felling, and are believed to indicate some aspect of the timber trade including where the wood came from, whom it belonged to, or its final destination. A general discussion of these marks can be found in Jorgen Wadum’s “Historical Overview of Panel-Making Techniques in the Northern Countries,” inThe Structural Conservation of Panel Paintings: Proceedings of a Symposium at the J.

        "Catalogue Entry": "The Artist:Filippo Lippi is one of the presiding geniuses of Florentine art. No other fifteenth-century painter was so various and consistently inventive. Yet he has not always enjoyed the esteem he commanded among contemporaries. In his celebrated essay on Florentine painting first published in 1896, Bernard Berenson sounded some of the themes that have been repeated in one manner or another: “If attractiveness . . . sufficed to make a great artist, then Filippo would be one of the greatest, greater perhaps than any other Florentine before Leonardo . . . That he became more [than an illustrator]—very much more—is due rather to Masaccio’s potent influence than to his own genius; for he had no profound sense of either material or spiritual significance.”Lippi certainly watched Masaccio and Masolino at work in the Brancacci Chapel in Santa Maria del Carmine, Florence, where in 1421 he took holy orders. However, his earliest paintings reveal someone looking beyond the austere gravity of Masaccio’s work. His presence in Siena in 1428 and Padua in 1434 enlarged his cultural horizons and the sculptures of Donatello and Luca della Robbia and the descriptive naturalism of Netherlandish painting proved more potent than Masaccio in shaping a style remarkable for its unorthodox compositional solutions, its interest in problems of light and color, and its emphasis on artifice and improvisation. With the single exception of Leonardo da Vinci, no other fifteenth-century painter was so open to revising his work—of maintaining an improvisatory approach to the act of painting. During the course of execution his compositions invariably become more complex, the space less clear, and the decorative elements more dominant. His emphasis is on those critical indicators of artistic genius in the fifteenth century—invention, fantasy, and artifice (invenzione, fantasia, artificio). This approach places him at odds with the grand tradition extending from Giotto and Masaccio through Piero della Francesca to Andrea del Sarto and Raphael. He belongs, instead, to a no less vital line extending from Lorenzo Monaco to Botticelli and Pontormo.What stands out in Lippi’s work is the way he consciously plays with elements of both traditions and incorporates naturalistic details into his art of the imagination: it is this confluence that makes him a key figure in the history of Florentine painting. During the 1440s Lippi became the preeminent painter in Florence. Indeed, with Donatello’s move to Padua in 1444 and Fra Angelico’s transfer to Rome in 1445, only Domenico Veneziano and Andrea del Castagno offered a real challenge to his supremacy. He became the favorite painter of the Medicis and received numerous commissions from them and their associates, responding to the new courtly taste promoted by the Medici by reinterpreting the terms of Gothic art without relinquishing the naturalism inherent in his earlier work.In 1452 Lippi received the commission to fresco the choir of the cathedral at Prato (previously offered to Fra Angelico) with a cycle of frescoes of the lives of Saints Stephen and John the Baptist. Completed in 1465, these frescoes are among the masterpieces of Italian art. Their lively quality of narration, richly ornamented surfaces, imaginative architectural settings and rocky landscapes—used to enhance the storybook-like narrative action—stand at the opposite pole to the detached grandeur of Piero della Francesca’s almost exactly contemporary frescoes of the True Cross in Arezzo. That his powers of invention did not diminish is demonstrated by his frescoes in the cathedral of Spoleto, painted between 1466 and 1469 with the assistance of his longstanding assistant Fra Diamante and, possibly, Botticelli, who together with his son Filippino was his greatest heir. That Leonardo also studied his paintings (those of the late 1430s) should serve as a warning against taking at face value his irresistibly pleasing style. “The most singular master of his time,” is how his work appeared to one informed critic at the end of the fifteenth century.The Picture:This is one of the defining works of Italian portraiture: the earliest surviving double portrait, the first to place the female sitter in a notional interior, and the first to include a landscape background. Each of these novelties was to be taken up and developed by artists only later in the century. Lippi has left us a number of altarpieces that include donor portraits, and these allow us confidently to date this work to about 1440–44, contemporary with theAnnunciationin the Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Antica, Rome. That altarpiece also provides close analogies for the landscape seen through a window. Although there is the possibility that the portrait was commissioned to celebrate the birth of a child, the sumptuous clothes and many rings worn by the woman are appropriate for a bride, as is the mottolealtà(loyalty) embroidered in gold threads and seed pearls on her ermine-lined sleeve. The male is no less expensively garbed in scarlet and wears a hat designating his high social rank. On the basis of the coat of arms displayed by the male sitter, Breck (1913) tentatively identified the couple as the Florentine Lorenzo di Ranieri Scolari (a relation of the celebrated general Pippo Spano) and Angiola di Bernardo Sapiti, who are usually said to have been married in 1436 (see Pompeo Litta,Familie celebri di italia, Milan, 1819–83, fasc. LXVII [1850], disp. 122, tav. I and IV). Although Breck's identification has been widely accepted, in 2013 Katalin Prajda proposed instead that the coat of arms upon which the male figure's hands rest belongs to the woman rather than the man. Prajda suggests identifying the sitters as Francesca di Matteo Scolari (ca. 1424–after 1481) and Bonaccorso di Luca Pitti (born ca. 1418 or 1420), who were married by 1444, noting as well that Francesca's father-in-law, Luca di Bonaccorso Pitti, may have commissioned the work.In this innovative portrait, Lippi retains the conventional profile view of both sitters but includes their hands. As with most later portraits, he situates the female in a domestic interior, the boxlike shape and steeply foreshortened ceiling of which recall depictions of the Madonna and Child (Donatello's so-calledPazzi Madonnain the Bodemuseum, Berlin, and Scheggia'sMadonna and Child with Two Angelsin the Museo Horne, Florence). By contrast, the male stands outside the room, gazing through a lateral window opening, while a second window offers a view onto a landscape that, it has been suggested, may record property belonging to the family. Syson (2005) has noted analogies with the Annunciation.The degree to which Lippi has generalized the features of the sitters is as notable as the implausibility of the \"room\" that encases the woman. One need only compare their features with the portraits he includes in the roughly contemporaryCoronation of the Virgin(Uffizi, Florence) to see the extent to which detailed physiognomic description has been suppressed. The difference in intent comes to the fore if Lippi's portrait is compared to Petrus Christus's 1446 portrait of Edward Grimston (collection of Lord Verulam, on loan to the National Gallery, London), in which the highly individualized sitter is placed in a far more plausible room, with careful attention to the light falling through the panes of a circular leaded-glass window. This comparison is important, since there has been a persistent attempt to link Lippi's innovations to his awareness of Netherlandish practice.Lippi's two figures occupy different planes in space, with the female figure dominant and the male in a subordinate position—as an observer. In itself, this is a reversal of the conventions of portraiture in the fifteenth century. Examination with infrared reflectography (see fig. 1 above) demonstrates that the artist carefully rethought the placement of the woman's hands, one over the other, to achieve an effect of demure self-possession. Initially her right index finger was longer and the thumb rested on top of the left hand. More interestingly, the male sitter was initially shown with one hand raised to just below his chin (there is an overlap with the shadow his face casts), as though actively gesturing. To an even greater degree, he was not simply an observer but an interlocutor. It is also clear from the IRR that his profile was enlarged beyond what was initially drawn in. The female's dress had a higher waist and the pleats were also different. The coat of arms was painted over the architectural molding/ledge and adjustments were made to the left-hand molding of the window.Baldwin (1986) has emphasized the importance of the gaze in amatory poetry and suggests the pertinence to the picture of a verse from the Song of Solomon (2:9) in which the bridegroom—in Biblical exegeses understood to be Christ—\"stands outside our wall, peeping in at the windows, glancing through the lattice.\" The motif of the lover first seeing his beloved at a window is something of a topos in Renaissance literature. In Lippi's portrait the elaborately coiffed and dressed woman is offered not only to the possessive gaze of her male suitor-husband, but to the admiration of the viewer.Wright (2000) is surely correct that the sharply defined shadow cast by the male sitter onto the back wall relates to Pliny's well-known account of the origin of painting, in which a lover traces the contours of the shadow cast by his beloved (Natural History35.5.15, 43.151). Quintilian, too, refers to this story (Institutio oratoria10.2.7), to which Leon Battista Alberti makes reference in his treatise on painting,De pictura. Quintilian cites the story as a criticism of art as mere imitation. The shadow can thus be understood not only as a record of the lover's features, but as an invitation to read the picture as a poetic conceit—something we would expect from the artist described by Cristoforo Landino as \"artificioso sopra modo\" (artful beyond measure)—in his 1480 commentary to theDivine Comedy.Sales (2016) has explored the meanings attached to the conspicuous gesture of the male figure, with index and baby finger raised in amanu cornuta, or horned-hand gesture, often associated exclusively as indicating a cuckhold. He demonstrates that it is used also to convey blessing and protection. As he explains, \"The male figure in Lippi’s painting enters the woman’s private space and faces her general direction without meeting her gaze . . . Displayed conspicuously to ward off danger, the gesture [made by the male] blesses and protects the family lineage, symbolized by the heraldic arms, as embodied by the beautiful woman who is the focus of the man’s action. Simultaneously the sexual associations of the horned hand invoke the masculine generative force necessary for a fertile union and energize the space itself as a site of procreation within the honorable and chaste context of marriage.\"Viewed in this way, Lippi's innovations suggest the intention to create a visual analogue to the conceits of Petrarchan poetry as well as to celebrate the social function of marriage and family. The painting thus asserts portraiture as a poetic evocation of love as beauty as well as it commemorates a betrothal, marriage, or birth; a programmed presentation rather than a record of the actual appearance of the sitters.Keith Christiansen 2014; updated 2023",

The woman is dressed in French-inspired attire and her sleeve is embroidered with letters spelling \"lealta\" (faithful), a clue that the man appearing in the window is possibly her betrothed.

        "Catalogue Entry": "Samuel Cooper was orphaned as a child and brought up, together with his brother Alexander (1609–?1660), also a miniaturist, by his uncle John Hoskins (active by ca. 1615–died 1665). He was the pupil and for many years the partner of Hoskins, who is said to have been jealous of his accomplishment. He set up on his own about 1641–42. He was much patronized by Oliver Cromwell (1599–1658) and the Puritans and after the Restoration by Charles II (1630–1685) and his pleasure-loving court. He was recognized in his lifetime throughout Europe as the most accomplished miniaturist of his age. At his peak, Cooper is remarkable for the breadth of his handling and the subtlety of his interpretation of character.The miniature was once in France, since a torn blue-edged stock label fixed to the back of the frame is lettered in ink1724 / par Cooper. In the packing material at the back between the frame and the miniature are two green cards cut from a balcony ticket priced at two shillings and sixpence for a concert in 1856 in aid of the Organ Builders' Benevolent Institution, indicating that the miniature was then in Great Britain.Verbally, Richard Allen (1977) accepted this as an authentic work by Samuel Cooper, but Daphne Foskett (1972) and Hermione Waterfield (1978) rejected it. It is by Cooper, with an authentic signature, but it has suffered so severely as to lose most of its quality.The identification of the sitter as Lucy Percy (1600?–1660), second daughter of Henry Percy, ninth earl of Northumberland, who became in 1617 the second wife of James Hay, later first earl of Carlisle (died 1636), is an early one but has to be regarded with suspicion. This lady's beauty, reputation, and intrigues caused her name to be attached to many otherwise unidentified seventeenth-century portraits. There is no reason to suppose that she wore a widow's cap seventeen years after her husband's death.[2015; adapted from Reynolds and Baetjer 1996]",
        "Technical Notes": "There are several areas of flaking—the left eyebrow and, most notably, the left cheek—but the damage is in fact much more extensive.

The frame encloses Botticelli'sLast Communion of Saint Jerome(14.40.642).",
        "Intro Description": "With 14.40.642:The subject of the picture is taken from Eusebius'sDe Morte Hieronymi ad Damasum. Saint Jerome is shown in his cell near Bethlehem, supported by his brethren. Above the bed are two juniper branches, palms, a crucifix, and Jerome's cardinal's hat. The picture was painted for the Florentine wool merchant, Francesco del Pugliese, who described it in a will of 1502. Although pictures of Saint Jerome in his study, surrounded by ancient texts, were popular among Humanists, the subject of the present picture, with its devotional character, is shown less frequently and may be related to the fact that Pugliese, like Botticelli's brother, was a supporter of Savonarola. The painting dates from the early 1490s.The exceptionally fine frame on this picture has a painted lunette by Bartolomeo di Giovanni (active 1480, died 1501), who not only collaborated with Botticelli on at least one occasion but copied this picture. The frame may have been made for one of these copies.",

Schidlof,The Miniature in Europe, Graz, 1964, vol. 2, p. 651), who was painter to Louis XV of France in 1762 and exhibited portraits and flowers in miniature at the Salon between 1774 and 1782. No miniature by him is recorded, and therefore the attribution cannot be checked. The work is by a French miniaturist working about 1760.The sitter wears the badge of the Order of Saint-Louis.[2016; adapted from Reynolds and Baetjer 1996]",

        "Notes": "The subject of this picture is taken from Ovid'sMetamorphoses, VIII, lines 298–425, although Rubens would have known the story from other ancient sources. Having slain the wild boar sent by Artemis to ravage the plains of Calydon in his father's territory, Meleager, son of Oeneus, gives the boar's head and skin to Atalanta, daughter of the king of Arcadia.A painting by Jordaens (Koninklijk Museum, Antwerp) is generally recognized as a work influenced by Rubens's composition. Janssens's lostAtalanta and Meleager, which has been dated between about 1609 and 1623, probably precedes this picture; Rubens has transformed Janssens's composition into something entirely new.A good replica of The Met's painting is in the Gemäldegalerie, Kassel. Among other known versions of this composition are a copy in the Musée de Tours, and a picture cited by Goris and Held (1947) as in the Museum of Braga, Portugal. Four figures derived from those of Rubens appear in a landscape in an etching by Willem Panneels (published in F. W. H. Hollstein,Dutch and Flemish Etchings, Engravings and Woodcuts . . ., Amsterdam, n.d., vol. 15, p. 122, no. 26, ill.).Engraved by Bloemaert.The panel has been cradled.",
        "Intro Description": "Like many of Rubens’s other works, this painting illustrates a story from theMetamorphosesof the Roman poet Ovid (completed A.D. 8). Meleager has killed a monstrous boar and presents its head to Atalanta, with whom he has fallen in love. In the background is a snake-haired Fury—a reference to the subsequent feuding over the boar’s hide that will lead to Meleager’s death. Although a splendid example of Rubens’s depiction of substantial, fleshy bodies, the picture is not in uniformly good condition. Parts are abraded and the drapery over the right shoulder of Meleager has been reconstructed on the basis of a workshop copy.",

Both the items depicted and the size of the painting contribute to an impression of opulence and enjoyment. Nevertheless, the prominent detail of a clock in the upper right suggests that time is swiftly passing for the absent revelers who have assembled this feast.",

        "Catalogue Entry": "Along with theVirgin and Child with Saint Anne(The Met14.40.633), theSalvator Mundi(Savior of the World) is one of two exceptional paintings by Albrecht Dürer in the collection of The Metropolitan Museum. Placed before a brilliant green background, Christ raises his right hand in blessing while holding a crystal orb in his left. A significant feature of this painting is its unfinished state, recorded as early as the 1573 inventory of  the Willibald Imhoff collection, which lists “der Salvator, so Albrecht Durer nit gar ausgemacht hat” (“the Salvator, not quite finished by Albrecht Dürer”). In 1861 Alois Hauser, a restorer in Bamberg, cleaned the painting and described its condition at the time: the draperies, hair, and background were completed; the face and hands had been sketched in; and highlights had been applied to the forehead and nose. To Hauser’s statement, we should add that the globe was abandoned at a midstage of painting. Also notable are a whitish wash over portions of the underdrawing in the neck area, employed to tone down the prominent dark black strokes, as well as applications of the orangey pink underpainting of the flesh at the base of the neck near the collar of the robe. Before 1895 a subsequent owner had the painting “finished” by a restorer in Augsburg named Anton Deschler. Finally, cleanings before 1906 and in 1939–40 removed most of  the overpainting, thus exposing additional unfinished portions.Despite the somewhat checkered history and compromised state of this work, its authorship has rarely been questioned. Its autograph quality is especially evident in the sensitive rendering of  Christ’s head and hands and in the sophisticated realization of texture and sculptural form in the richly colored draperies. Dürer lavished extraordinary attention on the fully worked-up underdrawing, portions of which can be seen with the naked eye, especially on the head, neck, and hands; infrared reflectography has revealed similar underdrawing in the draperies (see fig. 1 above). It is also noteworthy that, in this preliminary design stage, Dürer not only carefully modeled the orb with light and shade but also indicated a reflection of  a window on its left and right side. He was also careful to offset the contours of the robe and indicate the refraction of the light through the crystal. This extensive and complex underdrawing is not the norm for Dürer and is equaled only in a limited number of examples, including his self-portrait of 1500, now in the Alte Pinakothek, Munich.Such finished underdrawing has a direct parallel in Dürer’s drawings on paper of the same period, in which he adopted the exacting technique he had developed for engraving. The extremely dense passages of parallel hatching and cross-hatching in pen in the shadowed areas of Christ’s head are even further reworked with another layer of curved strokes in brush to indicate the cavity of the neck. The structure of these strokes resembles that in Dürer’s drawingsHead of a Young Manof 1503 (Clark Art Institute, Williamstown) andHead of a Curly-Haired Boyof 1508 (G. M. Gathorne-Hardy collection, Donnington Priory, Newbury, England). The exceptional level of finish elsewhere in the underdrawing is paralleled in some of Dürer’s preparatory studies for his first major commissions in Venice in 1506,The feast of  the Rose Garlands(Národní Galerie, Prague) andChrist among the Doctors(Museo Thyssen-Bornemisza, Madrid). Among these, the drawings for hands in the Albertina, Vienna, and the Germanisches Nationalmuseum, Nuremberg, are strikingly similar to the underdrawing of Christ’s right hand: all exhibit obliquely angled cross-hatching for the deepest shadows, short, commalike strokes indicating the edges of forms, and bold, even, parallel strokes across the fingers. In the preparatory drawings for the draperies in these two paintings, Dürer employed penwork in darker and lighter inks and white heightening on blue paper that is comparable to the structure of the penstrokes used to create the volumes of  forms in Christ’s draperies in The Met's panel. Both in underdrawing and in drawing on paper, Dürer achieved a remarkable variety in surface textures modeled by light and shade through the particular arrangement of strokes of the pen and brush.TheSalvator Mundiderives from late medieval prints such as an engraving by Master E.S. (later reworked about 1466–67 by Israhel van Meckenem), which provided Dürer with a model for Christ’s pose, somewhat furrowed brow, tightly curled beard, and ringlets of hair falling onto the shoulders. Yet the work is also imbued with a Renaissance spirit that owes its inspiration to Jacopo de’ Barbari, whom Dürer perhaps met on his first trip to Italy in 1494–95 and certainly encountered sometime between 1500 and 1503, when the Italian was working for emperor Maximilian I in Nuremberg. Two paintings of Christ by de’ Barbari, in the Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister, Dresden, and Schlossmuseum in Stadtschloss, Weimar, dating from about 1503, show the same pose and treatment of the hair and beard. The rich, saturated colors in Christ’s robe and cloak, particularly in the Weimar example, reflect an Italian palette that was readily assimilated by Dürer. But above all it is the poignant, human expression of Jacopo’s Christ that Dürer adopted.Exactly why Dürer left this work unfinished will never be known. The most immediate reason may have been the sudden outbreak of the plague in Nuremberg, which caused him to escape to Venice in the late fall of 1505. Interestingly enough, though, this was not the only work that Dürer abandoned in midstage. Around 1503–5, perhaps considering illustrations for a book of prayers, he produced a number of woodcuts of hermit saints. Two unfinished panels of about the same date as theSalvator Mundi, now in the Kunsthalle Bremen, portray a fictional encounter in the wilderness between Saint John the Baptist and the fourth-century hermit saint Onuphrius. Like The Met's painting, these works reflect a new interest in Italian models. Saint John, in his forward-facing contrapposto, recalls poses that Dürer was studying in preparatory drawings for his famous 1504 engravingAdam and Eve, while Saint Onuphrius appears to be derived from a figure of Job at the lower left in Giovanni Bellini’s San Giobbe altarpiece (Gallerie dell’Accademia, Venice), which Dürer must have seen on his first trip to Venice in 1494–95. In both these incomplete works, the underpainting of the figures, the initial description of their draperies, and the features of the landscape have been laid in, but the finishing glazes, which produce the final definition of form, have not yet been added.Eduard Flechsig (1928) was the first to suggest that the two unfinished panels in Bremen were the wings of  a triptych, with theSalvator Mundias its centerpiece. His proposal immediately attracted scholarly attention and found many supporters, as well as a few notable detractors. Erwin Panofsky (1943) rejected it because of the incongruity of the three backgrounds, noting the lack of precedents for a central panel with an abstract background combined with wings having landscape backgrounds. Another objection might be the considerable difference in scale between the figures of the saints and Christ, although at least two other contemporaneous triptychs by Dürer show this type, namelyOswolt Krel and Two Wild Men with Shieldsof 1499 (Alte Pinakothek, Munich) and a drawing after a lost altarpiece representing the Vera Icon flanked by donor portraits of Jacob Heller and Katharina von Mühlheim (École des Beaux-Arts, Paris).Are the features that the three panels share—period of creation, unfinished state, similar early provenances in important collections in Nuremberg, and compatible sizes—coincidental, or were the works actually designed as a triptych? It finally became possible to test Flechsig’s hypothesis in January 2005, when the Bremen panels were brought to the Museum for technical examination. The support of all three paintings is linden wood, and their preparation with a chalk ground indicated that they were painted in northern Europe, not in Italy as has sometimes been suggested. All show intact painted edges and a wood reserve that proved they were painted within frames. Given their dimensions, the three could have formed a triptych, although the framing elements for such an arrangement would have been extremely narrow (about 2 centimeters).Yet, significant differences among the unfinished states of the three works immediately cast doubt upon their connection as a triptych. While the Bremen panels have been left uniformly at a midstage of painting, theSalvator Mundihas been brought up to a final form in most areas except for the head, hands, and orb. Infrared reflectography (fig. 1) revealed a fully worked-up underdrawing for theSalvator Mundiin areas not visible to the naked eye, but the same equipment did not show similarly complete preparatory drawings in the panels of  the saints. While the underdrawings of the Bremen panels are masterfully executed in Dürer’s typically sensitive, confident manner, they are less finished and applied in a more dilute manner—or perhaps in an underdrawing material, such as brown ink, that becomes transparent with conventional infrared reflectography. Although the two saints demonstrate Dürer’s highly proficient handling and execution, they do not show the same level of attention lavished on theSalvator Mundi. If the latter work was ever accompanied by wings, they would more likely represent the Virgin Mary and Saint John or Saints Paul and Peter, the founders of  the Church. The tall, very thin panels of the saints alternatively may have been planned to flank a central sculpture to form a shrine of the type being made in Nuremberg at that time.How then might The Met's work be understood as an independent painting, not as part of  a triptych? Significantly, one of the few paintings by Dürer worked up in a similarly detailed, meticulous way is the MunichSelf-Portraitof 1500. The full-face, frontal figure seen there was a form usually reserved in northern Europe at this time for icons of Christ. In addition, the sitter in this idealized formal portrait, with his hypnotic gaze, handsome face, and shoulder-length brown hair (Dürer was blond in other portraits), calls to mind the description of Christ in the famous Lentulus Letter, generally believed an accurate description and only later found to be a forgery. Dürer’s well-known intention to imitate or emulate Christ is also reflected in his drawingSelf-Portrait as a Man of Sorrowsof 1522 (formerly Kunsthalle Bremen) and in an engraving of 1513 in which his features are those of Christ imprinted on Veronica’s veil. The Christlike nature of  the Munich self-portrait has been ascribed to Dürer’s dual desire to represent humanity as created in the image of God and the artist himself as a creator.The MunichSelf-Portraitwas likely meant as a showpiece to demonstrate Dürer’s extraordinary abilities to his students and prospective clients alike. Most probably it was kept in the artist’s house during his lifetime, just as theSalvator Mundiwas. Could theSalvator Mundihave served a similar purpose in Dürer’s workshop? the exceptional attention he lavished on every stage of  workmanship, from the underdrawing to the final touches in the finished areas, does not speak logically for a commissioned work with a deadline. Rather, the painting was apparently kept close at hand by Dürer to work on as a further development of the concepts and aims of the self-portrait. Klaus Jürgens, who noted the extraordinary similarities between the two paintings (1983/84), even speculated that theSalvatorwas left unfinished precisely because the completed painting of Christ would have looked more and more like Dürer himself.When Dürer’s workshop closed after his death, the two Bremen panels and theSalvator Mundiwent their separate ways. An inventory of 1616 described the saints’ panels as being framed together. In the nineteenth century, when in the Felix collection, theSalvator Mundihad been separated from an old, still-existing frame that had a sliding lid bearing the date 1650 and the coat of  arms of the Haller von Hallerstein family, an illustrious previous owner. TheSalvator Mundiand theSaint OnuphriusandSaint John the Baptistseem never to have formed a triptych. Rather, what they have in common are revelations concerning Dürer’s workshop practice, style, and technique in the early years of  the sixteenth century.[2015; adapted from Ainsworth in Ainsworth and Waterman 2013]",
        "Technical Notes": "The panel support is composed of three boards of linden, with the grain oriented vertically; two of the boards originate from the same tree. The panel has been thinned and cradled, and the verso was coated with wax in 1935. There are two short splits in the panel: in the background to the right of Christ’s head, extending down from the top edge, and at the left extending from the lower edge. Additionally, hairline cracks and small losses are found along the panel joins.The presence of unpainted wood and abarbearound the perimeter indicates that the white ground preparation, containing calcium carbonate, was applied when an engaged frame was in place.The panel was not painted to completion. Examination of the unfinished portions of the composition with the stereomicroscope showed a thin, translucent lead-white priming over the underdrawing. In addition to the underdrawing visible in the unpainted portions, infrared reflectography revealed in the completed areas a carbon-containing underdrawing, executed with both brush and pen, that was fully worked up before the painting began. The painted composition follows the underdrawing precisely.The blue robe, red cloak, and green background are well preserved. The hair along the top of Christ’s head is severely abraded, but the long locks falling onto his right shoulder are well preserved and their finely applied highlights are intact. The hair falling onto his left shoulder is damaged and partially covered with very old repainting. Examination with the stereomicroscope confirmed that the thinly applied passages of paint on the flesh, beard, and orb are original, as are the more densely applied flesh paint along the collar and the red tincture in the lips and nostrils. All these delicate first stages in the painting process are abraded, which is understandable given the complex restoration history of the painting. The forehead and right cheek are peppered with small indentations that seem to be due to the collapse of the panel support, possibly from insect damage. There are losses on the bridge of the nose.See figs. 1–2 above for infrared reflectogram and x-radiograph.[2013; adapted from German Paintings catalogue]",

Dürer, the premier artist of the German Renaissance, probably began this work shortly before he departed for Italy in 1505 but completed only the drapery. His unusually extensive and meticulous preparatory drawing on the panel is visible in the unfinished portions of Christ’s face and hands.",

Visiting scholars have occasionally proposed other attributions, for example to Pieter de Ring (ca. 1615–1660 or later), which is understandable in view of De Heem's pervasive influence. There is no reason to doubt the typical signature in the upper right corner, and the picture, in motifs and particular passages of execution (especially the glass, the spiraling lemon peel, and the leaves), is completely characteristic of De Heem's work before the 1650s.The aesthetic appeal of this picture is wonderfully concentrated in the glass, with its white and yellow reflections suggesting bright light from a window. Graceful leaves and tendrils fairly float above the rim and descend to green grapes, which with the wine form a paean to Bacchic pleasures. The latter traditionally included erotic pursuits, as hinted here by the oysters, which had a reputation in the Netherlands (as in antiquity) for stimulating sexual appetites. Oysters, grapes, and even lemons were delicacies in De Heem's day, so that his subject suggests a certain level of society, one in which idle hours and beautiful pictures were counted among life's rewards.[2011; adapted from Liedtke 2007]",

Bernardo De Dominici, our primary but not always reliable source for the biographies of Neapolitan painters, emphasized Giuseppe’s mastery of the whole range of still-life painting, praising him as a “most singular painter of flowers, fruit, sweets, fish, game, vegetables, and other things.” But he especially praised his paintings of fish and sea creatures, noting how he surpassed others in “observing each thing from life” and further remarking that he became “an excellent, even incomparable painter.”[1] The scholar Raffaello Causa wrote, “never once does Recco yield; always composed, uncompromising, refined, abstract according to his own rule—one that is not in step with the times.”[2] Indeed, only in his late work does he create the kind of elaborate, open-air scenes with luxurious goods that were so popular in noble households north and south of the Alps (for example, hisStill Life with Crystals and an Enslaved African Servantin the Fundación Casa Ducal de Medinaceli, Seville, of 1679). In his large kitchen scenes and elaborate buffets he sometimes collaborated with Luca Giordano.Giuseppe’s work brings to a climax the defining features of Neapolitan still-life painting in which objects are shown sharply lit in a dark interior or against a dark background, thereby enhancing their physicality and dramatizing their presentation. This was directly related to the legacy of Caravaggio’s two sojourns in Naples (1606–7 and 1609–10). Paradoxically, by that date, Caravaggio no longer painted independent still lifes, though late paintings such as theAdoration of the Shepherds(Museo Nazionale, Messina; fig. 1) and the still controversialTooth Puller(Galleria Palatina, Florence; fig. 2) contain still-life details that demonstrate the ways in which his art was influential. It is only initially curious that the realization of this style took place in the 1630s rather than earlier. A major impetus was doubtlessly provided by the arrival in the city in 1616 of Jusepe de Ribera, whose paintings contain brilliantly realized still-life details. Though undocumented, he may also have painted independent still lifes, just as he is known to have painted two independent landscapes (Alba Collection, Madrid). The most significant example, dating from the 1650s, is a still life with the head of a goat (Museo Nazionale di Capodimonte, Naples; fig. 3).[3] Aniello Falcone (1607–1656), who had initially worked with Ribera, may also have played a role: in his painting of a concert (Museo del Prado, Madrid) one of the figures carries on his head an enormous vase of fruit and flowers, suggesting either his activity in this area or his collaboration with specialists in still-life painting. Another factor informing still-life painting in Naples were the Flemish still lifes available through the activities of foreign residents, such as Jan Van den Eynde, or Vandeneynden (1584–1630) and his son Ferdinand, and the Antwerp merchant/banker and collector extraordinaire, Gaspar Roomer (1596/1606–1674), who sent Neapolitan pictures north and imported Dutch and Flemish paintings to Naples—most famously Rubens’sFeast of Herod(Scottish National Gallery, Edinburgh).[4] Also present in the city were northern painters, such as Abraham Brueghel (see71.118).Giuseppe Recco was born into a family of painters. His father, Giacomo (1603–1654), was among the founders of still-life painting in Naples in the 1630s, known especially for his paintings of flowers in fantastical vases, emulated by his young son. Among Giacomo’s pupils was the brilliant still-life painter Paolo Porpora, whose work was important for Giuseppe. His probable uncle, Giovanni Battista Recco (ca. 1615–ca. 1660), excelled at paintings with fish, crabs, and other marine life, and these provided both the model as well as catalyst for Giuseppe’s pictures, such as the one in The Met. It is above all these paintings that De Dominici praises and that earned Giuseppe the reputation as the outstanding master of still lives in Naples. His success may be measured by the illustrious collectors and patrons who owned his work. He is recorded as “painter to the Marchese de los Vélez, viceroy of Naples from 1675 to 1682, and his paintings figure in the inventories of such prestigious collections as that of Gaspar Méndez de Haro, marchese del Carpio. De Dominici says he was invited to Spain to paint for Charles II. According to De Dominici, the artist, who by then had been knighted, set out for Spain in 1695, and following a difficult voyage, he died shortly after landing in Alicante. He is reported to have had twelve children, one of whom, a daughter, Elena, became a painter. So also did Nicola Massa (not Maria, as mistakenly reported) Recco, who we now know was the nephew and not the son of Giuseppe Recco: he was, instead, the son of Antonio Massa and Marzia Recco, Giuseppe’s sister.[5]Our ideas about Giuseppe and his art have evolved significantly over the last quarter century. According to De Dominici, he spent an extended period in Lombardy, profiting from the example of still-life painters there. This turns out to not to have been true: his formation was entirely Neapolitan, but he was surely aware of northern and particularly Flemish painting from the collections in the city.[6]The Picture:An assortment of fish (among which is a red gurnard and a branzino), a cuttlefish and an octopus are displayed on a two-tiered, rocky ledge together with two large copper vessels and a basket that has been overturned by a cat that has snagged the octopus with its claws and chews on a tentacle while confronting the viewer with a defiant stare. Recco has signed the work with his initials twice: once in the lower left and then again with the seaweed. The presence and action of the cat give the picture a narrative element that enlivens the normally static quality inherent in still-life painting and that also elevates its ambition, since still life alone was thought secondary to history and figurative painting. In other pictures—among which the opulent Riches of the Sea with Neptune, Tritons and Two Nereids (New South Wales Art Gallery, Australia) or Still Life with a Fisherman (commissioned by Giacomo Paravagna, marchese di Noja and now in a private collection, Naples)—Luca Giordano provided the figures, thereby enhanced and elevating the still life with an allegorical, mythological, or narrative theme. There is general agreement that The Met’s picture dates from the 1660s and reflects Giuseppe’s response to the paintings of his uncle, Giovanni Battista, who was celebrated for his marine still lifes and is reported to have died in 1660 (this is according to a note sent to Filippo Baldinucci on 9 July 1675, but the exact date of his death is not certain). It is thus of interest that in the 1688 inventory of the collection of Ferdinand Vandeneynden in Naples is listed a painting by Giovanni Battista Recco described as: “kitchen utensils and things from the pantry with a cat that tugs as the neck of a heron”.[7] Given the nature of Vandeneynden’s collection, partly inherited from Roomer, there is naturally the question of whether Giovanni Battista and Giuseppe were responding to Flemish paintings in those collections.Keith Christiansen 2020[1] Bernardo De Dominici,Vite de' pittori, scultori, ed architetti NapoletaniIII, 1742, p. 95: “pittore singolarissimo di fiori, frutti, cose dolci, pesci, cacciagione, verdume, ed altro.” De Dominici treats the key figures of Neapolitan still-life painting in his biography of Giovanni Battista Ruoppolo (pp. 293–301).[2] Raffaello Causa,La pittura del seicento a Napoli dal naturalismo al barocco: La natura morta a Napoli nel sei e settecento(reprint fromStoria di Napoli), Naples, 1972, p. 1021, cited inRitorno al barocco da Caravaggio a Vanvitelli, exh. cat., Museo Nazionale di Capodimonte, Naples, 2009, p. 400, no. 1.2333.[3] The attribution of this picture to Ribera was first proposed inRitorno al barocco da Caravaggio a Vanvitelli, cited above in note 2, p. 380, no. 1.222.[4] For general survey of the importance of Roomer, see Francis Haskell,Patrons and Painters, London, 1980, 3rd ed. 1991, pp. 205–8, and R. Ruotolo,Ricerche sul '600 Napoletano: Mercanti, collezionisti fiamminghi a Napoli, Naples, 1982. Vandeneynden’s inventory, drawn up on December 2, 1688, is accessible on the Getty Provenance Index. Among the paintings listed are seven still lifes by Jan Fyt and nine by Giovanni Battista Ruoppolo, indicating his interest in both Flemish and Neapolitan still lifes.[5] See Gianluca Forgione,Nuovi contributi sulla natura morta napoletana: Nicola Massa Recco e altre questioni, 2019.[6] For a survey of Giuseppe’s life based on archival and other sources, see the entry of Gianluca Forgione in theDizionario Biografico degli Italiani, vol. 86, 2016, available online: http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/giuseppe-recco_%28Dizionario-Biografico%29/[7] See the Getty Provenance Index, as above in note 4, under no. 131: “Un altro di pal. 10 e 8 con cornice liscia robbe di cucine, e robbe di dispenza con una gatta che tira il collo ad un arione mano di Titta Recco 60”",

        "Intro Description": "This animated scene shows a cat caught in the act of devouring an octopus. The painting, dating from the high point of Recco’s career, shows the painter’s exceptional ability to depict a dazzling range of surfaces and materials, from iridescent fish scales, slimy mollusks, and other crustaceans, to hammered copper. Recco, who painted the seaweed into the letters of his initials (G R), was certainly aware of Flemish and Spanish still lifes, which were popular and much admired in Naples in the seventeenth century.",

New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2000–.The Painting:In this tightly cropped composition, the sitter is turned to the left in a three-quarter view against a dark background. Over his white shirt, the man wears a fur-trimmed garment and a purplish-blue robe with a rich brown damask sleeve. A hatpin with the letters “IM” is affixed to the man’s beret. In his right hand, he holds a scroll with the Latin inscription “...omrpses/J[o]annes…/malbodius… pingeba[t]” (Joannes Malbodius painted [this]). This form of the artist’s name appeared for the first time in hisNeptune and Amphitriteof 1516 (Gemäldegalerie, Berlin; Ainsworth 2010, pp. 217–19).The sitter of this portrait, which once belonged to the famous eighteenth-century British painter Sir Joshua Reynolds (1723–1792), remains unknown. Some have suggested that the letters “IM” of the hat pin stand for the artist’s name in Latin, Joannes Malodius, better known as Jan Gossart or Jan Mabuse, offering the possibility of a self-portrait (Burroughs and Weale 1932). However, the physiognomy of the sitter does not compare well with other proposed portraits of Gossart, such as the engraving by Johannes Wierix for Domenicus Lampsonius’sPictorum aliquot celebrium Germaniae inferioris effigies(Portraits of Some Celebrated Artists of the Low Countries) of 1572 (see fig. 1 above). Max J. Friedländer (1906, p. 34) proposed that the “IM” stands for “Iesus Maria,” signifying the man’s piety. Alternatively, the Roman capitals may indicate that the sitter is a humanist and could denote the first letters of a personal motto or device.[1] Eric Larsen (1960, pp. 88–89) noted that deacons of professional guilds are known to have worn such pins, and this may identify the métier of the man, if not his name.The Attribution and Date:Jan Gossart was a splendid and much sought-after portrait painter, as his many extant examples attest.[2] Jan’s earlier works in particular reveal his admiration for two predecessors who achieved great fame as portraitists in Bruges, namely Jan van Eyck and Hans Memling. Like them, Gossart portrayed his sitters as dignified yet aloof, not overly haughty, but always highly refined and elegant. From Van Eyck and Memling, Jan also assimilated his portrait formula—the three-quarter view of his sitters, often facing left, and the placement of their hands in the lower left or right corner of the composition (for Memling, see14.40.626–27,1975.1.112,14.40.648). One thinks immediately of Van Eyck’s 1432Portrait of a Man (Léal Souvenir)in the National Gallery, London (fig. 2; Bauman 1986, p. 42) who also holds a scroll, but with illegible script.The combination of naturalistic observation and painterly virtuosity, so admired by the contemporaries of Van Eyck and Memling, also was achieved in Gossart’s best independent portraits. As with Memling’s portraits, for example the portrait of Tommaso Portinari14.40.626, Gossart paid careful attention to the subtle modeling of the flesh tones, the stubble of the beard, the cleft chin, and the individually painted hairs of the eyebrows. However, Gossart’s far more sculptural treatment of the bony structure of the face separates his work from that of Memling, who opted for a softer, more generalized approach. The x-radiograph of Gossart’s painting shows how the flesh tones have been rather densely worked up, and the infrared reflectography indicates—as was usual for Gossart’s working method—minimal underdrawing at the contours of the hat and head, the features of the face, and in the man’s right hand (see Technical Notes and figs. 3, 4). The portrait has sometimes been dated to around 1516 (Herzog 1968, pp. 238–39), but most scholars assign a slightly later date in the early 1520s (see Refs.). Dendrochronology supports the later dating (Klein 2010, p. 432). It thus falls in line with Gossart’s routine and less ambitious portraiture of the early1520s, such as thePortrait of a Man (Self-Portrait?)in the Pushkin State Museum of Fine Arts, Moscow, or the Portrait of a Man in the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna (Ainsworth 2010, pp. 250–53; figs. 5, 6).Maryan W. Ainsworth 2020, adapted and updated from Ainsworth 2010[1] Suggested by Jos Kodeweij in an email of September 5, 2009 to the author.[2] See Ainsworth 2010, pp. 18–20, and nos. 36–63, pp. 236–302.",
        "Technical Notes": "Support:The panel was constructed from two planks of vertically-grained oak, with the left plank measuring 33 cm wide and the right only 2 cm. Dendrochronological analysis of the panel suggested an earliest possible creation date of 1512 with a more plausible date of 1518 onwards.[1] The wood originated in the Baltic region. Dendrochronology also revealed that the wood came from the same tree as that used for thePortrait of a Merchantby Jan Gossart (National Gallery, Washington, 1967.4.1).At some point before entering The Met’s collection, the reverse of the panel was planed down, and a cradle attached. The panel now measures 9 mm thick on average. All four edges of the panel have been planed somewhat, likely during the cradling process. As noted above, the left plank is substantially wider than the narrow plank on the right; however, this disparity does not appear to be the result of any significant re-sizing of the panel.[2] Traces of a bevel are evident on the reverse of the original panel, with less remaining on the reverse of the right side, suggesting that the right plank was marginally wider originally.Preparation:The panel was coated with a chalk-containing white ground, followed by a lead white priming layer.[3] Infrared reflectography revealed a cursory underdrawing that laid out the basic facial elements and the position of the figure.[4] The underdrawing has a hard crumbly appearance, particularly evident along the left edge of the hat (see fig. 4 above).Paint Layers:Gossart’s mastery of fine details is on display in this polished portrait. He has described the tiny features around the eyes with astounding precision, including the narrow shadow cast by the upper eyelid and the hint of a highlight on the lower lid (fig. 7). Fleshtones were softly blended, so that individual brushstrokes are usually not discernible with the exception of the minute strokes used to paint the sitter’s stubble. Gossart’s attention to detail extended to the costume where he picked out the hairs of fur at the lining of the robe and the fine points around the white collar. Yet, the pattern of the brocade on the sitter’s proper right sleeve does not exactly follow the folds, flattening the illusion somewhat.Gossart made one minor alteration to the painting: he initially planned to position the man’s collar slightly higher but did not fully paint it before shifting the collar down, as can be seen in the x-radiograph (fig. 3) and the infrared reflectogram. The initial contour of the collar is somewhat visible as a pentiment.The paint layers are generally in good condition although there is some evidence of pigment degradation in the man’s blue coat, discussed below, and the dark glazes in his hand are somewhat rubbed. Changes in refractive index due to the normal aging of the paint film have altered the contrast in the dark vest and patterned sleeve, making details difficult to read.The man’s coat displays a mottled ashy appearance that is likely attributable to material changes in the paint. Under the microscope, the shadows displayed a glassy, blanched appearance, suggesting the presence of a faded red lake pigment. A microscopic cross-section sample was removed adjacent to an area of loss near the bottom of the painting and high-powered microscopic examination combined with Raman spectroscopy identified the pigments used to paint the blue overcoat.[5] Atop the white preparatory layers, the artist applied a paint comprised of a finely divided carbon black and red lake pigments. The upper paint layer was found to be a mixture of ultramarine blue and a red lake pigment with a slightly larger particle size than the red lake used in the lower layer. Examination with high magnification revealed that the red lake in the uppermost layer had begun to fade, with pigment particles towards the top of the layer displaying the most fading, although very large red lake particles retained their color to a greater degree regardless of location within the paint film. While some of the ultramarine particles had a characteristic bright blue hue, others had a grey, translucent appearance. It appears that the ultramarine has lost its color unevenly within this paint layer, contributing to the mottled appearance of the man’s coat. Similar fading of red lake and ultramarine blue paints has been documented in other paintings associated with Gossaert, including aVirgin and Childin The Met’s collection (17.190.17) and aVirgin and Childin a private collection in New York.Karen Thomas 2009; adapted by Sophie Scully 2024[1] Wood identification and dendrochronological analysis completed by Dr. Peter Klein, Universität Hamburg, report dated July 27, 2007. The report can be found in the files of the Department of Paintings Conservation. “The youngest heartwood ring was formed out in the year 1501. Regarding the sapwood statistic of Eastern Europe an earliest felling date can be derived for the year 1510, more plausible is a felling date between 1514..1516….1520 +x. With a minimum of 2 years for seasoning an earliest creation of the painting is possible from 1512 upwards. Under the assumption of a median of 15 sapwood rings, a creation is plausible from 1518 upwards.”[2] Observations about wood construction and later interventions made by Alan Miller, Conservator, and Kristin Holder, Assistant Conservator, July 2024.[3] Analysis with Raman spectroscopy of a microscopic paint sample was completed by Dr. Silvia Centeno, Research Scientist, Department of Scientific Research; a full report can be found in the conservation file.[4] Infrared reflectography was acquired with a Merlin Indigo InGaAs near-infrared camera fitted with a StingRay macro lens customized for the wavelengths covered by the camera, 0.9 to 1.7 microns, 2008.[5] Raman spectroscopy completed by Dr. Silvia Centeno, Research Scientist, Department of Scientific Research.",

        "Notes": "This picture is among the most impressive products of the collaboration between Rubens and his older colleague, Jan Brueghel. Rubens must have determined the overall design and painted all the figures, with Brueghel probably responsible for everthing else in the picture. It was most likely produced about 1614–15, the date proposed by Held (1941) on the basis of the style of the figures and their relationship to others in Rubens's oeuvre. The subject is taken from Ovid'sMetamorphoses, VIII, lines 547–610, in which Theseus, having conquered the Minotaur of Crete, was returning to Athens with his companions when they arrived at the river Achelous. The river-god invited the heroes to rest in his house, rather than cross the swollen stream, and told them the poignant tale of his love for Perimele. Rubens followed the text closely. The setting depends on one of Bernard Salomon's woodcuts inLa Métamorphose d'Ovide figurée(Lyons, 1557), and the two most prominent figures in the composition, Theseus and the bearded man at the near side of the table, derive from classical sculpture.This picture, or a version of it, appears in the cabinet of paintings and artist's studio represented in theAllegory of Paintingby an anonymous Flemish master (C. de Yturbe collection, Château d'Anet, France; see Maeyer 1955) and in a nearly identical picture attributed to Jan Brueghel the Younger (private collection, The Netherlands; see Schwartz 1993). Copies of the Museum's painting are in the Musée Granet, Aix-en-Provence, and in the Museo Correale de Terranova, Sorrento. Another copy was sold in Lucerne in 1938.An Italian provenance previously thought to be that of The Met's painting must belong to the copy in Sorrento (see Gardner n.d. and correspondence in archive file).The panel has been cradled.",
        "Intro Description": "Rubens and Brueghel collaborated on several mythological and religious pictures that showcased their respective skills. In this panel, Rubens designed and painted the figures and Brueghel painted everything else, revealing his gifts as a landscape and still-life painter. Here, the river god Acheloüs explains to the Greek hero Theseus that his former lover Perimele has been transformed into a distant island by Neptune so that she could remain forever within the river’s embrace. The artists combined classical learning, nudes based partly on ancient sculpture, the wonders of nature, and the mastery of craft into an encyclopedic display meant for a sophisticated collector.",

        "Catalogue Entry": "The Artist:Tarchiani was a significant master of early Baroque painting in Florence. He made two trips to Rome, around 1590 and then again in 1601–7. If, during the first, he was in touch with the leading exponents of a late Mannerist style of painting with naturalistic inflections, such as practiced by Federico Zuccari, the second one made him aware of the revolutionary art of Caravaggio and his use of light to give his figures a strong, physical presence. However, Tarchiani’s brand of naturalism remained strongly based on a Florentine love of descriptive detail and elegance of design, represented by an artist such as Jacopo da Empoli (1551–1640). The style he evolved was perfectly suited to the religious climate of Counter-Reformation Florence and also to the sophisticated tastes of patrons such as the poet/playwright Michelangelo Buonarroti the Younger (1568–1646)—the grandnephew of the sculptor Michelangelo. Between 1615 and 1617, Tarchiani was employed in the decoration of the Casa Buonarroti, where he would have worked alongside Artemisia Gentileschi.The Painting:The picture shows Saint Dominic, the thirteenth-century founder of the Dominican order, his upper torso bared, his outer robe cast aside, kneeling before an altar adorned with a crucifix and a vase of flowers; the flowers and altar cloth are described with an attention to detail typical of the artist. The saint flagellates himself as an act of penance. An open book—the source of his meditations—is propped against the dais of the altar while behind him is a table with an hourglass and two books; the hourglass is an emblem of the passage of time and the transience of life. A second version of the composition, with very minor variations, was on the market in Italy in 1999 (with the dealer Pratesi, Florence: see Giovanni Pagliarulo, inPitture fiorentine del Seicento, exh. cat., Palazzo Ridolfi, Florence, 1987, p. 28; and Francesca Baldassari,La pittura del Seicento a Firenze, 2009, p. 669, fig. 405). That painting has been dated just after 1607, upon the artist’s return from Rome, and this is likely to be the date of the present picture as well.Keith Christiansen 2016",
        "Provenance": "sale, Sotheby's, London, July 8, 1999, no. 69, to Brille; Brian J. Brille, New York (1999–2015)",
        "Notes": "A second version, with minor variations, was with the dealer Giovanni Pratesi, Florence, in 1987 (Giovanni Pagliarulo inPitture fiorentine del Seicento, exh. cat., Palazzo Ridolfi, Florence, 1987, pp. 28–29, no. 5, ill. in color; see also Francesca Baldassari,La pittura del Seicento a Firenze, 2009, pp. 668–69, no. 405, ill.). Pagliarulo dated that picture just after 1607, upon the artist’s return to Florence from Rome, and this is likely to be the date of The Met's picture as well.",
        "Intro Description": "Tarchiani’s painting transforms a troubling subject—the thirteenth-century founder of the Dominican order flagellating himself—into a serene, meditative composition. With the attention of a still-life painter, he isolated a series of captivating motifs, including the linearity of the altarpiece viewed in profile contrasted with the soft folds of Dominic’s partially discarded robes. Although trained in the academic tradition of late sixteenth-century Florentine art, Tarchiani made two prolonged visits to Rome, where he studied the work of Caravaggio and Orazio Gentileschi. Between 1615 and 1616 he was employed on the same project as Orazio’s famous daughter, Artemisia Gentileschi, who arrived in Florence in 1613.",

        "Title:": "Saint Peter and Simon Magus",

        "Medium:": "Tempera on wood",

        "Object Number:": "15.106.1",
        "Catalogue Entry": "Benozzo Gozzoli was a principal assistant of Fra Angelico, contributing to the frescoes in San Marco, Florence, the Chapel of Nicholas V in Rome, and the vault frescoes of the chapel of San Brizio in the cathedral of Orvieto. In 1444 he signed a contract to work for three years with Lorenzo Ghiberti on the third set of bronze doors—theGates of Paradise—for the Baptistry of Florence. His work was probably in the nature of chasing, but Ghiberti’s richly detailed narrative style left an enduring mark on Gozzoli’s work, readily visible in The Met’s four panels.Offner (1956) first established that these panels formed a predella seen by Vasari (1568) in the Alessandri family chapel of the church of San Pier Maggiore, Florence: \"Ed in San Pier Maggiore, nella cappella degli Alessandri, fece quattro storiette di figure piccolo di San Piero, di San Paolo, di San Zanobi quando resuscita il figliuolo della vedova; e di san Benedetto\" (And in San Pier Maggiore, in the chapel of the Alessandri, he painted four small stories with little figures of Saint Peter, Saint Paul, Saint Zenobius when he resuscitated the son of the widow, and of Saint Benedict). Vasari erroneously attributed the scenes to Pesello (i.e., Francesco Pesellino, whose biography is among the most confused in theVite) and did not mention the authorship of the main panels, which, in fact, were painted by Lippo Benivieni (active ca. 1296–1320; Galleria degli Uffizi, Florence). As with the Museum’s altarpiece by Taddeo Gaddi (10.97), this is a case of modernizing a fourteenth-century altarpiece by the addition of a new frame or predella. Although Vasari does not mention a fifth scene and although Ahl (1996) has, on the basis of erroneous measurements, argued that there was none, the width of each of the surviving scenes matches that of the individual saints and there must, therefore, also have been a predella scene beneath the panel of the Virgin, which measures 75.3 x 56.2 cm. When in 1784 the church of San Pier Maggiore was demolished, the panels were returned to the Alessandri family, from whom The Met’s panels were acquired in 1915.The main panels were arranged in the following order: Saint Zenobius, Saint Peter (titular saint of the church), the Madonna and Child, Saint Paul, and Saint Benedict (the founder of the order that officiated in the church). In the first scene of the predella, Zenobius, the fourth-century bishop of Florence, resuscitates a dead child on the square in front of San Pier Maggiore. According to the saint’s legend, a Frankish pilgrim left her sick son in the saint’s care. The boy died while Zenobius was officiating at a procession at San Pier Maggiore. Returning from Rome, the mother found her son dead. Taking up his body, she met the saint in Borgo degli Albizzi. He knelt in prayer, raising the boy back to life. The scene was depicted by, among others, Ghiberti (on a shrine for the relics of Saint Zenobius for the cathedral) and Domenico Veneziano (in a predella panel now in the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge). Like Ghiberti, Gozzoli shows the boy both dead and resurrected and he divides the spectators into two groups receding into space. But to an even greater extent, he eliminates the dramatic element. The façade of the church in the background is typically Florentine and can be compared to, for example, that of San Felice. In the second scene, as recounted in theGolden Legend, the apostles Peter and Paul expose the false magic of the sorcerer Simon Magus at Emperor Nero’s court. Simon had had a tower built and declared he would ascend to heaven. Peter ordered Paul to pray, whereupon the demons supporting Simon let him plummet to the ground. In the third scene is shown Paul’s conversion on the road to Damascus, as told in the Acts of the Apostles 9:3–5. The active poses of the fleeing figures find analogies both in the scene of David and Goliath on Ghiberti’s bronze doors and in the predella of Fra Angelico’s San Marco Altarpiece. In the fourth scene, as recounted in Gregory the Great’sDialogues(book 2, chapters 14–15), Totila, king of the Goths, kneels before Saint Benedict. He had tested the saint by dressing up a guard as himself and sending him \"in all regal pomp.\" Benedict, however, recognized the ruse. \"Then Totila himself in person went unto the man of God; and seeing him sitting afar off, he durst not come near, but fell down to the ground: whom the holy man (speaking to him twice or thrice) desired to rise up and at length came unto him, and with his own hands lifted him up from the earth, where he lay prostrate: and then, entering into talk, he reprehended him for his wicked deeds.\"The subjects of two of the scenes—the miracle of Saint Zenobius and the fall of Simon Magus—were treated a second time by Gozzoli in a predella for an altarpiece (main panel in the National Gallery, London) commissioned in 1461 by the Confraternity of the Purification of the Virgin and Saint Zenobius, whose oratory was at the convent of San Marco. Inasmuch as the commission for the Alessandri predella is not documented, a comparison between the scenes—one on the collection of H.M. the Queen, Hampton Court, and the other in the Gemäldegalerie, Berlin—would seem the best way to establish its approximate date (see Christiansen 1983 for the most extensive analysis). Ahl (1996) has argued that The Met's compositions must precede those for the Purification of the Virgin altarpiece and has dated them to ca. 1441–44—which is to say, shortly after Gozzoli’s work under Fra Angelico in San Marco and before his earliest documented independent works. This would be astonishingly early, and most scholars have, more persuasively, argued the opposite: that The Met's scenes follow rather than precede those associated with the Purification altarpiece and reveal a more mature artist (see, for example, Christiansen 1983 and Boskovits 2002). The architecture is at once more varied and shows a greater understanding of Renaissance style, the figures are both bulkier and more individualized, the drapery is more fastidiously described, and the compositions shown are more richly articulated with a view to dramatic impact. As Boskovits has observed, the Alessandri predella scenes \"reveal the effort to adapt to the new cultural climate of Florence\" upon his return to the city (between 1449 and 1459 Gozzoli was principally active in Umbria). The matter is important for establishing the probable patron of The Met's predella. Ahl suggests Alessandro Alessandri (1391–1460), who also commissioned an altarpiece by Filippo Lippi in The Met (35.31.1a–c), in which Alessandro is shown with two of his five sons, presumably Jacopo (1422–1494) and Antonio (1423–after 1480), either of whom, as well as Alessandro's brother, might also have commissioned the predella from Gozzoli. Alessandro was a Medici supporter and held the important political office of Gonfaloniere in 1448.Keith Christiansen 2012",

In them, the fifth-century bishop of Florence resuscitates a dead child on the square in front of San Pier Maggiore; the magician Simon Magus crashes to the ground at the feet of Emperor Nero when Saint Peter commands the demons who suspended him in midair to let him go; Saint Paul falls from his horse at the apparition of Christ; and Totila, king of the Goths, asks the blessing of Saint Benedict. From his work with Fra Angelico and the sculptor Lorenzo Ghiberti, Gozzoli evolved a style of great charm and narrative engagement.",

        "Catalogue Entry": "The Artist:For a biography of Hans Memling, see the Catalogue Entry forThe Annunciation(17.190.7).The Painting:In this charming painting the Virgin gently holds the Christ Child, who playfully ruffles the folios of a devotional book. It is likely that this panel once formed the left half of a devotional diptych, as the Virgin and Child gaze toward the right, presumably at the likeness of an unknown patron.[1] This Virgin and Child is linked stylistically to a group of works of the same subject produced by the workshop of the Bruges painter Hans Memling (active by 1465–died 1494). In the sweetness of the Virgin’s expression and the lively Christ Child, this diptych wing echoes the Met’sVirgin and Child with Saints Catherine of Alexandria and Barbara(14.40.634).[2]Scholarly consensus places Memling in the Brussels workshop of Rogier van der Weyden (born ca. 1399–died 1464) in the years before he settled in Bruges in 1465 after Rogier’s death. Memling would have been a journeyman then, and open to assimilating compositional motifs derived from Rogerian prototypes. Indeed, the idea of the Christ Child’s playful crumpling of the pages of the Virgin’s devotional book in the present work harks back to Rogier’s Durán Madonna (Museo del Prado, Madrid; see fig. 1 above) where the infant Christ's gesture is similar. Likewise, the Christ Child grasping the white cloth on which he rests, derives from Rogier van der Weyden’sVirgin and Childnow in the Musée des Beaux-Arts, Caen (fig. 2). The use of the devotional diptych structure itself may be credited to Rogier, who is thought to have invented the format.[3]Only two devotional diptychs confidently attributed to Memling survive: theDiptych of Maarten van Nieuwenhoveof 1487[4] (fig. 3) and theVirgin and Childdiptych of 1485–90 (Art Institute of Chicago).[5] The Met’sVirgin and Childwas likely produced in the context of the Memling workshop’s diptych production or by an artist aware of examples like these, who was interested in meeting the market demand for this popular subject.Attribution and Date:The composition and style of The Met’s painting were clearly influenced by Memling, and in 1902 Weale attributed the panel to the master himself.[6] However, this attribution was quickly—and correctly—contested by Hulin de Loo who assigned the work to the School of Memling, linking it to another Virgin and Child painting, then in the Earl of Northbrook’s collection (now The Met,1975.1.111).[7] De Vos identified the same painter at work not only in these two examples, but also in a picture of the same subject from the Bache collection (The Met,49.7.22), whom he called the Master of the Bache Virgin.[8] However, these three works were not painted by the same hand. Rather, they represent different artists with varying degrees of exposure to Memling’s working methods, who adopted the master’s popular configurations. Of these three paintings, the present example is closest to Memling’s workshop, yet certain details in this work reveal an artist whose powers of observation as well as execution were not up to the master’s standards.[9]Whether or not this artist had direct experience in Memling’s studio requires further clarification through technical examination, namely with infrared reflectography, x-radiography, and microscopy (see Technical Notes). The underdrawn design, not evident throughout the image but only identifiable in certain areas of the figures, defined the placement of folds of the Virgin’s sheer veil and created delicate modeling with parallel hatching in the Virgin’s forehead, proper left hand, and in the shadow under Christ’s proper left thigh (fig. 4). What little preparatory drawing is visible does not match Memling’s underdrawing style, which was much looser and more spontaneous toward the end of his career.[10] Minor changes in the underdrawing suggest an artist who is not slavishly following a model; for example, the long, dainty fingers of the Virgin’s proper left hand have been repositioned. X-radiography does not reveal significant compositional changes in the paint stages (fig. 5). However, it does show the typical build-up of lead white in a sculptural approach that conforms to late fifteenth-century technique. This technique is likewise typical of Memling’s works.Further evidence of a potential connection between this painting and Memling’s studio is provided by dendrochronological analysis. By examining the growth ring patterns of the panel on which the composition is painted and comparing the results with a master chronology, Peter Klein established that the wood used for The Met’s painting and Memling’sBathsheba at her Bathof about 1485 (Staatsgalerie Stuttgart) come from the same tree.[11] This suggests, but does not prove, the possibility that the painter of The Met’sVirgin and Childwas working as an assistant in Memling’s workshop late in that master’s career.Nenagh Hathaway 2017[1] See John Oliver Hand and Ron Spronk,Essays in Context. Unfolding the Netherlandish Diptych, Cambridge and New Haven, 2006, pp. 37–41.[2] The Met’s collection includes two other depictions of the Virgin and Child, both linked to Memling’s paintings of the same subject, but which are not autograph works:1975.1.111and49.7.22.[3] See Lorne Campbell,Renaissance Portraits: European Portrait-Painting in the Fourteenth, Fifteenth, and Sixteenth Centuries, New Haven and London, 1990, p. 120.[4] See De Vos 1994, pp. 278–83, no. 78, and Barbara G. Lane,Hans Memling, Master Painter in Fifteenth-Century Bruges, Turnhout, 2009, p. 267, no. 14.[5] For an illustration of the Chicago diptych see Martha Wolff, Ed.,Northern European and Spanish Paintings before 1600 in the Art Institute of Chicago, New Haven and London, 2008, pp. 250–59, ill. pp. 252–53 (color).[6] See Weale 1902, p. 89.[7] See Hulin de Loo 1902.[8] See De Vos 1994, pp. 395–96, especially n. 12.[9] See Technical Notes.[10] See Maryan W. Ainsworth, “Hans Memling as a draughtsman,” inHans Memling: Essays, Ed. Dirk de Vos, Ghent, 1994, pp. 78–87. Till-Holger Borchert describes Memling’s late underdrawing style in reference to the Nájera panels in “Memling’s Antwerp ‘God the Father’ with Music-making Angels” inLe Dessin sous-jacent dans la peinture: colloque IX, 12–14 septembre 1991: dessin sous-jacent et pratiques d'atelier, Leuven, 1995, pp. 153–68.[11] Dendrochronology by Dr. Peter Klein (report dated May 30, 2014, in European Paintings archive files).",
        "Technical Notes": "Support:The support is a single plank of oak, with the grain oriented vertically. Dendrochronological analysis indicated an earliest possible creation date of 1480 with a more plausible date of 1487 upward. The wood originated in the Baltic/Polish region.[1] The plank came from the same tree as that used for Hans Memling’sBathsheba at her Bath, King David, and a Young Boy(Staatsgalerie, Stuttgart; inv. 644). The panel has been thinned to 3/16 inch (0.4 cm) and cradled.Preparation:The panel was prepared with a white ground. Traces of abarbeindicate that the panel was in an engaged frame when the white ground was applied and that the original dimensions are preserved.Examination with infrared reflectography revealed that many contours were underdrawn with cursory lines using what appears to be a soft, dry material.[2] This underdrawing appears very faint in infrared and is difficult to discern. Furthermore, many of the underdrawn contour lines are obscured by the painted contours and so the underdrawing is most perceptible where adjustments were made, for example, where the Virgin’s left fingers were repositioned (see fig. 4 above). Shading was added to the underdrawing using hatched lines, including the dark passages along the proper left side of the Virgin’s face, along the proper left side of the Child’s face and his left arm and the Virgin’s left hand. There is no evidence of a transfer technique.Paint Layers:The method of painting is characteristic of the late fifteenth century, most tellingly in the careful buildup of volume in the fleshtones and the sparing application of lead white for the highlights only, best observed in the x-radiograph (fig. 5). However, the handling is not nearly as accomplished as that seen in paintings firmly attributed to Memling, particularly in the finer details. In the eyes of both the Virgin and the Child, the artist made several adjustments to the position and size of the irises and then defined the eyelids using rather thick strokes of salmon pink and dark brown (fig. 6). This handling is slightly awkward compared to Memling’s assured yet delicate depiction of eyes. Furthermore, the gold brocade was painted in a less accomplished manner than that seen in examples of brocade in Memling’s paintings. The gold threads were painted as if by rote using a network of thick strokes of light yellow atop a dark ochre-colored paint (fig. 7). The monotony of these strokes gives the impression of a flat field of gold rather than the modulation that would result from light striking the threads from one direction, the upper left, as in the rest of the scene. Yet, the artist has better understood the directionality of the light in his depiction of the highlights on the gemstones and pearls. These technical inconsistencies indicate an artist who may have had the example of a master’s paintings to guide him, but was not as accomplished in practice.Sophie Scully 2017[1] Wood identification and dendrochronological analysis completed by Dr. Peter Klein, Universität Hamburg, dated May 30, 2014. The report can be found in the files of the Department of Paintings Conservation. The youngest heartwood ring was formed out in the year 1469. Regarding the sapwood statistic of Eastern Europe an earliest felling date can be derived for the year 1478, more plausible is a felling date between 1483…1485….1489 +x. With a minimum of two years for seasoning an earliest creation of the painting is possible from 1480 upward. Under the assumption of a median of fifteen sapwood rings and two years for seasoning, as probably usual in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, a creation is plausible from 1487 upward.[2] Infrared reflectography completed with a Merlin Indigo InGaAs near-infrared camera with a StingRay macro lens customized for the wavelengths covered by the camera, 0.9 to 1.7 microns.",

Liedtke (2007) records seven additional autograph self-portraits by Dou, along with one known from copies.A variant of this composition, without the foliage at right, was sold at Parke-Bernet, New York, on May 16, 1951, no. 33. Another variant, cropped, and with a different relief of putti under the window, was sold at the Dorotheum, Vienna, on October 15, 1996, no. 282, as Circle of Jan van Mieris, wood, 33.5 x 24 cm (formerly private collection, Buenos Aires). A copy sold at Galerie Fischer, Lucerne, on December 2, 1993, no. 2050, may be the same work listed in Hofstede de Groot 1907, p. 438, no. 282a. Hall 1963 and Baer 1990 record additional copies.The relief depicted below the window appears in several paintings by Dou and is a copy after a marble relief of 1626 by François Duquesnoy (1597–1643) in the Galleria Doria Pamphilj, Rome. There exist numerous sculpted and pictorial copies after the original. The Museum owns a version by Jacob de Wit (Children Playing with a Goat,07.225.257).This painting was engraved by Pierre Alexandre Tardieu (1756–1843).[2010; adapted from Liedtke 2007]",

        "Catalogue Entry": "The Artist:For a biography of Giacomo Ceruti, see the Catalogue Entry forA Woman with a Dog(30.15)The Picture:A bearded man with tussled black hair and white beard is shown quarter-length, his head turned toward the viewer as he displays a pug, whose paw he holds affectionately in his hand.  The picture is painted with a meticulous attention to such textural details as the beard and salt-and-pepper eyebrows, the short fur of the dog, and the fabric of the cloak, with its velvet-lined collar.  As suggested in correspondence with Francesco Frangi and Alessandro Morandotti—two scholars who, together with Mina Gregori, have contributed so much to advance our knowledge on the artist—this wonderfully sympathetic portrayal of an aging man and his pet belongs to an advanced phase of Ceruti’s career.Date and Theme:Following his move to Venice in 1736, Ceruti’s art took on a more sophisticated character marked by a movement away from the realistic premise of his earlier work in Brescia—the Lombard city where he had first established his reputation—and, in particular, of the great series of impoverished people and beggars that he painted in Bergamo for the Avogadro family (more generally known as the Padernello cycle from their discovery there in the twentieth century (see fig. 1 above). The pictures that form that cycle have the arresting effect of frank, unembellished depictions of reality and, as such, constitute a landmark of European painting. Beginning in the mid-1730s, Ceruti’s work shows a tendency toward a less raw and more picturesque naturalism, with the sitters often wearing exotic or foreign costumes. For example, we know of a picture of a young woman in Armenian dress that Ceruti painted for the French minister of Parma, Guillaume du Tillot, and of another with a man in Turkish dress. Ceruti also depicted himself as a pilgrim in a painting now in Abano Terme (near Padua). This portrayal is in keeping with the increased interest throughout Europe in exotic dress and non-European cultures, found also in literature and theater—especially opera. Concerning this shift in Ceruti’s work, Morandotti has observed, “In his Paduan and Venetian period starting in the mid-1730s, the painter tried his hand at fantasy half-figures, creating a rich repertoire freely inspired by the series of character heads that Giovan Battista Piazzetta had established as a true artistic genre.” The compositional norms thus became more formal and the style more elegant as Ceruti competed for a place in the sophisticated market of Venice. The quality of unadorned directness that is such a conspicuous feature of the artist’s early, Brescian painting is subordinated to a different intention. Yet, as Morandotti has also remarked, “Bearing in mind the stylistic differences and the deeply Lombard character of Ceruti’s works, we can understand how the painter, following the fashions of his time, created a repertoire of human types that was never too generic, but always reliably recorded the expressive and sentimental particulars of faces—no ‘deviation,’ therefore, from his talent as a painter of reality but simply an adaptation to international styles.”[1]In composition, figure type, and style The Met’s picture bears close comparison with two paintings inventoried in 1802 in the Milanese collection of Giacomo Melzi (1720–1802) and dated by Frangi and Morandotti to about 1740–45.[2] This was following the artist’s stay in Venice, where he painted for Field Marshal Johann von der Schulenburg (1661–1747), who had retired to Venice following his battles against the Ottomans and formed an outstanding collection in Palazzo Loredan on the Grand Canal. Ceruti is documented in Milan between 1742 and 1744 and in Piacenza between 1744 and 1746. He then returned to Milan. The Melzi pictures form pendants, with, in each case, a bearded man. In one the sitter wears a richly decorated red coat and fur hat and holds a pug. In the other the sitter belongs to a lower social strata, is simply dressed with a cape and cap, and holds a cat. The Met’s painting of a female domestic servant holding a dog (30.15) also has a pendant in which a maidservant holds a cat. Whether this picture had a pendant is not known. Dominic Ferrante (in an email) has noted that the same figure with his dog appears in a painting of a card game in the North Carolina Museum of Art in Raleigh (fig. 2). That work, too, has been dated around 1740 and unquestionably reflects Ceruti's familiarity with the lowlife scenes of Pietro Longhi.Keith Christiansen 2019[1] Francesco Frangi and Alessandro Morandotti,Giacomo Ceruti: Popolo e Nobiltà alla vigilia dell’età dei Lumi, exh. cat., Robilant + Voena, Milan, 2013, p. 56 (English supplement pp. 15–16).[2] Frangi and Morandotti 2013, pp. 54–56, nos. 13–14.",

        "Intro Description": "An aging man holds his pug up to his face, much as we might pose for a photograph with a favorite pet. Ceruti’s penchant for depicting people in society’s margins earned him the nickname of “Pitochetto” (little beggar). Then, upon moving to Venice in 1736, he encountered the pan-European fascination with foreign dress that seems to be alluded to here in the acorn-shaped buttons on his coat. While eliminating much of the grit found in his earlier subjects, he nonetheless reliably recorded the expressive and sentimental particulars of individual faces. Ceruti adds an artistic flourish by inscribing the swirls of the man’s beard with the wet paint on the handle end of his brush.",

        "Intro Description": "Hoping to recapture the success he had achieved withMadame Georges Charpentier and Her Children(07.122) at the Salon of 1879, Renoir sought to paint the daughters of his friend Catulle Mendès. In addition to the girls’ manifest charm, he undoubtedly counted on the notoriety of their bohemian parents to gain attention: their father was a Symbolist poet and publisher, and their mother was the virtuoso pianist Augusta Holmès. Renoir completed the commission in a matter of weeks and immediately exhibited the large canvas in May 1888, but the response to his new manner of painting, with its intense hues and schematized faces, was unenthusiastic.",

        "Catalogue Entry": "The Artist:Isabey was born in Nancy, where he studied with the painter Jean-Baptiste Charles Claudot (1733–1805), who also taught Jean-Baptiste Jacques Augustin (1759–1832; see17.190.1120a, b) and Jean Antoine Laurent (1763–1832). He went to Paris in 1786 and received some patronage from Marie Antoinette; however, he rose to a preeminent role among the early-nineteenth-century French miniaturists through his pupil Hortense de Beauharnais (1783–1837). She introduced him to Napoléon I, who was her stepfather and brother-in-law. Isabey became his court painter and had to maintain a number of studio assistants to help him provide the great number of miniatures of the emperor which he was called on to produce. His earlier works were done on ivory, but in the second decade of the nineteenth century he adopted the new technique of painting on paper stretched over sheets of metal. This enabled him to work on a larger scale and contributed to the fluent brushwork and luminosity of his later portrait miniatures.The Miniature:In a letter written to The Met in 1908, the sitter's daughter, Cornelia Prime, states that this miniature is one of only four American ladies painted by Isabey, and shows her as a young bride on her wedding trip to Paris. Augusta Temple Palmer (1807–1840) married Rufus Prime in 1828. She was the daughter of William Lambe Palmer, captain Eighteenth Light Dragoons, who was acting British consul general in New York in 1798, and was the granddaughter of Sir John Temple, British consul general to the United States in 1785–98. Her maternal grandmother, Lady Elizabeth Temple, was the daughter of James Bowdoin, governor of Massachusetts.[2016; adapted from Reynolds and Baetjer 1996]",

        "Catalogue Entry": "This portrait of the artist's cousin Hartogh van Moerkerken (1622–1694), his first wife, Sibilla Nijkerken (1625–1665), and their son Philippus (1652–1688) is generally dated 1653–54 on stylistic grounds, and more specifically on the basis of the boy's apparent age (he was born on January 8, 1652, and seems here to be about two years old). Hartogh was the son of the artist's paternal aunt Maria, who in 1610 married the Delft goldsmith Justinus (or Joost) Jansz van Moerkerken. The younger Van Moerkerkens also settled in the area of Delft and The Hague, in the village of Monster. The man in The Met's painting was States General representative to the district of Den Bosch ('s Hertogenbosch).The composition has not been modified and is consistent with the designs of several group portraits and genre scenes painted by Ter Borch in the early 1650s, such asThe De Liedekercke Family(Frans Halsmuseum, Haarlem) of about 1654. In both works Ter Borch departs from the usual convention in Dutch portraiture by placing the women in positions of honor, to their husbands' right.

        "Intro Description": "In this portrait of his cousin Hartogh van Moerkerken with his wife, Sibylla, and their son, Ter Borch broke with convention by depicting the wife on the left—traditionally the superior, and male—side of the panel. The composition is asymmetrical, lopsided, and dynamic, and the young husband’s gesture of showing a pocket watch to his wife gives the portrait an element of storytelling. This emotionally convincing depiction of a nuclear family signals a break with the dynastic imagery of previous generations, although an older tradition persists in the three coats of arms clustered in the upper left-hand corner.",

The former can now be identified as a copyist of Ribera; the latter is a mis-transcription for Bartolomeo Passante (1618–1648), who painted in a quite distinctively different style (correspondence with Nicola Spinosa).For the identification of the Master of the Annunciation to the Shepherds as Juan Dò, see:Giuseppe De Vito, \"Variazioni sul nome del Maestro dell'Annuncio ai pastori,\" inRicerche sul '600 napoletano: Saggi e documenti 1996–1997, Naples, 1998, pp. 7–62.Giuseppe De Vito, \"Juan Dò riconfermato,\" inRicerche sul '600 napoletano: Saggi e documenti 2003–2004, Naples, 2004, pp. 85–91.Giuseppe De Vito, \"Alcuni dipinti inediti o poco noti di Juan Dò,\" inRicerche sul '600 napoletano: Saggi e documenti 2008, Naples, 2009, pp. 33–38.Andrea Donati, \"Giovanni Dò e i temi sapienziali,\" inRicerche sul '600 napoletano: Saggi e documenti 2008, Naples, 2009, pp. 57–69.",

The present painter’s name remains unknown, though similar handling and palette are found in a small group of works executed in Naples between around 1620 and 1640. The conceit of the mirror offering two views and evoking sight and self-knowledge are found to similar effect in Elisabeth Vigée Le Brun’sJulie Le Brun, Looking in a Mirror(1787), also part of The Met’s collection.",

        "Notes": "This panel is generally assigned to Van Dyck's Italian years. Placing it in the artist's oeuvre is complicated by its seemingly unfinished state, and by the existence of several versions. Ludwig Burchard, in a letter of 1954 (copy in Rubenianum, Antwerp), thought none of the surviving versions autograph. The versions in Turin, Ghent, and Greenville, South Carolina are very probably copies; the one in Munich (Bayerische Staatsgemäldesammlungen) is more impressive, but was catalogued in 1924 as a copy of the Museum's picture. See Liedtke 1984 for a discussion of the painting's technique.Engraved by Lorenzi (see John Smith,A Catalogue Raisonné of the Works of the Most Eminent Dutch, Flemish, and French Painters . . ., vol. 3, London, 1831, no. 429).",
        "Intro Description": "At least eight versions of this tender image came out of Van Dyck’s workshop, and this one is at once the finest and least finished example. The deftly fluid brushstrokes loosely follow an incised underdrawing, which must have been traced from a preparatory drawing. Van Dyck would have kept this panel in his studio as a model for more finished paintings by himself and by assistants.",

        "Notes": "This is the definitive study (Dorra and Rewald 138; de Hauke 142) for the large painting exhibited at the 8th Impressionist exhibition of 1886, and now in the Art Institute of Chicago (DR139; H162). Seurat made numerous preparatory drawings and small oil sketches on panel for the Chicago painting, as well as at least three larger studies on canvas: the present picture, a study for the landscape, without figures, in the collection of Mrs. John Hay Whitney, New York (DR116; H131), and a detail of the standing couple at right (DR136; H138) in the Keynes Collection, King's College, Cambridge, on loan to the Fitzwilliam Museum. The Met also owns a smaller sketch (DR113; H117; The Met 1975.1.207) for the background of the composition.The island of La Grande Jatte, a popular recreation spot in Seurat's time, lies in the Seine to the northwest of Paris, near the suburbs of Asnières and Courbevoie.In a draft of a letter to Félix Fénéon (see Seurat 1890 and Herbert 1991), Seurat insists that both the Chicago canvas and the studies were begun on Ascension Day, May 22, 1884. Herbert believes that the painted studies were probably completed before December of 1884, when one of them was included in an exhibition.Huth (1946) suggests that either this picture or the landscape study in the Whitney collection was included in the 1886 New York Impressionist exhibition as \"Island Grande Jatte, Study, 1884\". This exhibition opened at the American Art Association Galleries on April 10, 1886, and moved to the National Academy of Design on May 25 of the same year. There is no mention in the catalogue of a picture with this title, although the Chicago painting was included as no. 112, \"Island Grande Jatte.\" De Hauke (1961) lists this painting as having been included in the exhibition \"hors catalogue\", although he gives the wrong date and erroneously states the first venue as the Durand-Ruel Gallery.",
        "Loan Restrictions": "Loan of this work is restricted.",
        "Intro Description": "This is Seurat’s final study for his monumental painting of Parisians at leisure on an island in the Seine (Art Institute of Chicago). Contrasting pigments are woven together with small, patchy brushstrokes, whereas in the mural-sized park scene—which debuted two years later at the 1886 Impressionist exhibition—Seurat used tighter, dot-like dabs of paint, a technique which came to be known as Pointillism (from the French wordpoint, or dot). He preferred the term Divisionism—the principle of separating color into small touches placed side-by-side and meant to blend in the eye of the viewer.",

        "Catalogue Entry": "This composition, in which half-length figures of the three magi are viewed behind a fictive arcade, offering their gifts to the Christ Child—an event celebrated in the Church as the Feast of Epiphany (January 6)—conforms to the rising popularity in the Netherlands for close-up devotional paintings that put the viewer in a direct relationship with the event depicted. On the ledge separating the viewer from the sacred figures is placed a receptacle with gold coins—the gift of the oldest king (or magus).The individual figures in the composition seem to reflect Hugo van der Goes’s altarpiece of the same subject, otherwise known as the Monforte Altarpiece (Gemäldegalerie, Berlin), which was painted around 1470. Among the similarities are the grouping of the Virgin and Child and eldest king, with the king shown in strict profile and with a similar vessel filled with gold coins; the oddly slipping hat of the middle-aged king; and the imperial globe offered by the young black king. Whether the master of The Met's picture freely adapted these features from Hugo’s Monforte Altarpiece or, as Friedländer (1926) and Winkler (1964) believed, took them over from a version of the composition by Hugo van der Goes himself, cannot be said with certainly, especially since Hugo is known to have introduced similar, close-up compositions, in particular for scenes from the passion.However, this composition, which does not imitate Hugo’s convincing psychological interaction between the figures, is unlikely to have been based directly on a lost version by the Ghent master (see Arndt 1961). Rather, the artist likely drew on isolated figure patterns derived from Hugo’s paintings and reassembled for a new version of the Adoration of the Magi, as was common practice especially in Antwerp workshops at the time. For example, the distinctive motif of the Virgin and Child, who rather warily regards the old king, is known from paintings in the circle of the Antwerp-based Master of Frankfurt as an isolated motif in different iconographical contexts (see Winkler 1964), as well as from his larger altarpieces, such as the Altarpiece of the Adoration of the Magi (Antwerp, Koninklijk Museum voor Schone Kunsten). Stephen Goddard (1983) identified the Master of Frankfurt with Hendrik van Wueluwe, who was a member of the Antwerp St. Luke’s guild from 1483 and died in 1533. He noted particularly the importance of Hugo van der Goes for the Master of Frankfurt, whose works show familiarity with the Monforte Altarpiece. Goddard attempted to define several artistic individuals within the rather incoherent group of works associated with the Frankfurt Master, among them the Watervliet Master, named after the Deposition triptych in the Church of the Assumption of Our Lady in Watervliet in Northern Flanders. He attributed The Met's painting to this master, a hypothesis that needs further study through the technical examination of the Frankfurt Master group.The survival of another nearly identical version of The Met's painting (Statens Museum for Kunst, Copenhagen) testifies to the popularity of this particular close-up version of the Adoration of the Magi for open market sale. That these were likely painted in the same Antwerp workshop sometime in the last two decades of the fifteenth century (according to Ringbom, ca. 1480; see Ringbom 1984) is supported by the dendrochronological analysis of The Met's painting (Klein 2014).Christine Seidel 2013; updated by Maryan W.

        "Intro Description": "Highly differentiated in their appearance here, the biblical Magi allegedly each came from a different continent: Asia, Africa, and Europe. As such, Caspar, Balthasar, and Melchior became the patrons and protectors of travelers and foreign merchants. In the early sixteenth century, Antwerp was the economic hub of western Europe. Its wealthy merchants identified closely with the Magi, thus prompting great interest in and the mass production of paintings of this theme. Another nearly identical version of this painting (Statens Museum for Kunst, Copenhagen) testifies to the popularity of this particular close-up version for open market sale.",

        "Technical Notes": "There is evidence that this is a fragment of a once-larger canvas. Local distortions of the canvas weave from the original stretching, cusping, are seen only on the top and left edges. It is likely that the original canvas incorporated a second study, and was subsequently cut in order to isolate this figure. The present canvas is irregularly shaped; a triangular-shaped insert was added when the work was lined, in order to create a rectangular format overall. The diagonal demarcation between the original canvas and the insert roughly parallels the diagonal edge of what appears to be the platform on which the model is lying, suggesting that the cut was made after the artist had finished with the painting. The triangular insert is on a canvas of finer weave and has been grounded with a much more x-ray opaque material; no attempt was made to mask the fact that this insert is not part of the original work.Visible in the bottom left corner is the shape of a foot, and within the model’s foot at the right edge are traces of a face, both relating to another figure study below the present one. This initial study, apparently of the same model, also nude, is vertical in format, and shows the figure seated, with his head and shoulders at a slight three-quarter-degree angle, his right leg bent up and his left leg extended. The figure can be imaged using the complementary techniques of infrared reflectography and x-radiography (see figs. 1–2 above). The infrared reflectogram shows some of the painted outlines of the initial male nude (including the left arm and the hand, located in the belly of the figure on the surface), and the blocking-in of the contour of the lower figure with broad strokes of dark brown paint. The facial features of the initial figure are also roughly indicated. The initial study was thinly painted, but since lead white was used in the flesh, a fairly strong image of most of the body is evident in the x-radiograph. Neither x-radiography nor infrared reflectography makes clear the lower section comprising the legs, which may have been less developed than the rest of the study. The flesh paint of the foot in the initial figure was left in place to serve as part of the second figure’s face.Charlotte Hale 2016",

        "Catalogue Entry": "Henrietta Maria (1609–1669), the queen consort of Charles I of England, was born in the Louvre and was named after both of her parents, Henry IV of France (1553–1610) and Marie de’ Medici (1573–1642). At the age of fifteen she was married to the king of England. Their first years together were unhappy, because the Duke of Buckingham, a favorite of the king, did all within his power to generate distrust of the young and inexperienced queen, a practicing Roman Catholic who spoke little English. After the assassination of Buckingham in 1628, the king seems genuinely to have fallen in love with his young bride. She bore him nine children, some of whom were to be the subjects of Van Dyck’s most beguiling group portraits.In this portrait Henrietta Maria is a woman of twenty-seven, expecting the birth of her sixth child, Princess Anne, born March 17, 1637. As the Civil War approached, she threw herself into English politics, seeking foreign aid to overthrow the Parliamentarians. In 1642 she sailed to Amsterdam and pawned a great part of the English crown jewels. Returning to England with munitions, she was nicknamed \"La Generalissima\" because of the military schemes she urged upon her mild-tempered husband. When the Royalist position became hopeless, she fled to France. She was living in the Louvre when she received word that her husband had been beheaded at Whitehall on January 30, 1649.A devout Catholic, Henrietta Maria spent her remaining years trying to convert her children to the Church of Rome and arranging advantageous marriages for them. After the Restoration in 1660, she returned to England for a brief period, taking up residence there in 1662. Three years later she left London for the last time and retired to her château at Colombes, near Paris.Henrietta Maria was painted by Van Dyck many times. His first portrait of her appears in the \"greate peece,\" the large canvas of the king and queen with their two eldest children (Royal Collection, London), executed shortly after the artist settled in England. On May 7, 1633, he was paid for nine portraits of Charles I and his wife. The queen is said to have given Van Dyck no less than twenty-five sittings, and his account of unpaid bills in 1638–39 lists thirteen portraits of \"la Reyne\": \"dressed in blue, price thirty pounds\"; \"dressed in white, price fifty pounds\"; \"for presentation to her sister-in-law, the Queen of Bohemia\"; \"for pre-sentation to the Ambassador Hopton\"; and so forth (see Carola Oman,Henrietta Maria, New York, 1936, p. 81).These portraits do not represent fresh and original essays. Most of them probably were repetitions—made by assistants to satisfy the demand for likenesses of her from family and friends—of one or another of the five basic formats the artist had devised for the queen. The existing portraits thus can be classified according to their prototypes, most of them established early in Van Dyck’s time in London: the three-quarter-length in white, originally placed in the King’s Bedchamber at Whitehall and now at Windsor; the three-quarter-length in the collection of the Earl of Radnor at Longford Castle (Wiltshire); the three-quarter-length in blue, of which the autograph version is not at present known; the full-length in state robes in the Schlossmuseum, Oranienburg; and the full-length in a hunting costume with her dwarf, Sir Geoffrey Hudson, in the National Gallery of Art, Washington.For the Wrightsman picture, Van Dyck used the same format he had invented four years earlier for the Radnor portrait, showing the queen standing slightly in front of the imperial crown, with her hands held one above the other at her waist. While the poses are the same, the plain background, the saffron yellow dress with its broad white lace cuffs and collar, the coiffure, and the queen’s engaging expression mark it as a new creation. A completely autograph work, it displays all the evidence of the master’s brushwork, including conspicuous alterations that only he would have made, such as the large pentimento running down the side of the queen’s left sleeve (originally the sleeve was about an inch wider). Similarly, the collar on her left shoulder was lowered, and there are slight changes in the outline of her right sleeve. A copyist would not have reproduced these changes, as they became noticeable only long after the portrait was completed and the underpainting gradually became visible with age. Further evidence that this is a primary version can be seen in the way the artist applied the background color. When the queen gave her first sitting, he merely laid in the paint immediately around her head. Then, at a later stage, he filled in the rest of the background but did not quite match the color, so that the first patch is somewhat darker, resembling an opaque halo around the head. Another feature indicating Van Dyck’s own work is the incomplete preparation of the canvas: a margin roughly three inches wide on all four sides of the canvas is unprimed. A painter setting out to copy the composition would have prepared the entire canvas at once, whereas Van Dyck, being uncertain of the ultimate dimensions of the picture, filled in these margins after he had completed the figure.The present portrait was executed in 1636 as a gift for Francesco Barberini (1597–1679). As Cardinal Protector of England and Scotland, he sought to improve relations between Charles I and the Church of Rome. Knowing of the king’s voracious appetite for collecting art, the cardinal sent a large group of Italian pictures to the queen; they reached England in 1636 and gave much pleasure to the royal family. In December of the same year, George Con, a papal agent to the court of Saint James’s and the queen’s personal confessor, reported to Cardinal Barberini, \"The Queen has not yet wanted me to present her the letter of Your Eminence, because having been apprised of its contents and knowing that I would ask Her Majesty for permission to take leave from her, she is delaying until her portrait is finished.\"As Oliver Millar first observed, the portrait mentioned by Con is probably The Met’s painting, which may well have been intended as a token of appreciation. The year after Cardinal Barberini’s pictures arrived in England, Henrietta Maria prepared a display of them in her chapel at Somerset House, and the following year she entrusted him with the responsibility of commissioning from Guido Reni a large painting for the ceiling of the bedroom of her house at Greenwich. Cardinal Barberini had also arranged for Gianlorenzo Bernini (1598–1680) to carve a bust of Charles I, which, unfortunately, was lost in the fire that destroyed Whitehall Palace in 1698. Henrietta Maria admired it so much that she solicited through the cardinal \"her own portrait\" by Bernini, for which Van Dyck painted his last portraits of her, a frontal view and two profiles, to serve as guides for the sculptor.[2016; adapted from Fahy 2005]",

        "Intro Description": "In Van Dyck’s portrait, the pregnant queen of England cradles her arms over her abdomen while standing next to a crown that advertises her rank. Henrietta Maria commissioned this painting as a gift for Cardinal Francesco Barberini, who viewed the devout French-born queen as a critical collaborator in his dream of regaining England for the Catholic Church. Destined for a leading patron of the arts in Baroque Rome, Van Dyck’s portrait was one of many diplomatic gifts that spread the artist’s fame and influence throughout Europe.",

        "Catalogue Entry": "This is one of two processional banners owned by The Metropolitan Museum made for confraternities—lay organizations affiliated with a church or religious charitable institution. Painted on both sides of a canvas support, these banners were carried through the streets in processions but could also double as altarpieces. This one is by the prominent Tuscan painter Spinello Aretino, who, as his name implies, was from Arezzo but had major commissions in Florence, Pisa, and Siena; the other is by the sixteenth-century north Italian painter Girolamo Romanino (1989.86). In both cases the members of the confraternity for which the banner was painted practiced penitential flagellation, and this explains the subject of the Flagellation that appears on one side of the banner.On the obverse of Spinello’s banner, Saint Mary Magdalen is shown enthroned, dressed in red, holding a crucifix in one hand and a pyx in the other (Mary Magdalen is traditionally identified as the person who anointed Christ’s feet with oil and perfume, so her emblem is a pyx). She is seated on a marble throne inlaid with mosaics of the type known as cosmatesque. Four music-making angels hover to either side of the saint while four members of the confraternity, dressed in their hooded white robes with cut-out holes for their eyes and an opening on their back for flagellation, kneel at her feet, their hands clasped in prayer. On the shoulder of their robes is the confraternity emblem, a pyx, indicating their devotion to Mary Magdalen. The angels may be a reference to the legend that when the saint dwelt in a mountain grotto in southern France, each day she levitated and heard angelic music; however, the presence of music-making angels would have been especially meaningful to a confraternity whose members sang hymns, orlaudi, as part of their devotions (Dehmer 2004). The instruments they play are (at the left, bottom to top): a psaltery, non-waisted fiddle, and double recorder; (at the right): a portative organ, shawm, and bagpipe (Slim 1980).The reverse of the banner shows Christ bound to a column beaten by two henchmen. The head of Christ is missing, the paint surface having been removed sometime between 1888 and 1913, by which time the banner had been relined. The detached head of Christ is now in the Campo Santo Teutonico of the Vatican (see fig. 1 above). The history of the banner can be reconstructed on the basis of a note by the Italian art historian Giovanni Battista Cavalcaselle, who saw it sometime prior to 1864 in the collection of marchese Francesco Ranghiasci-Brancaleoni in Gubbio (Gardner 1972). Cavalcaselle made a sketch of the obverse and reverse of the banner (Biblioteca Marciana, Venice; figs. 2–3), and he recorded that it came from a confraternity in Sansepolcro. He also recorded (Crowe and Cavalcaselle 1864) that there was a border of \"painted architecture adorned with medallions of saints,\" of which only vestiges then remained. Such borders are found on other banners—for example, one in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London (inv. no. 781-1894). On the basis of the appearance of Mary Magdalen’s pyx on the robes of the confraternity members who kneel at her side, Dabell (1983) identified its original location as the Confraternita di Santa Maria Maddalena, whose oratory in San Sepolcro was instituted in 1334 (Weppelmann 2011). As noted by Franklin (letter of June 16, 1998, in departmental files; see also Weppelmann 2011), the banner (orgonfalone) is cited in a testament of 1416 in which the widow Simona di Angelo di Pirro Dini commissioned a stained glass window for the oratory that was to include an image of Mary Magdalen similar to that on the banner (\"figura Sancte Marie Magdalene, prout est in ghonfalone dicte Societatis\"; Archivio di Stato, Florence, Notarile Antecosimiano, 19282, Francesco Sisti, 1413-48, f. 22 r). In 1530 the oratory was converted into a church of Francescan Observants. There, in 1619, the banner is again mentioned on an altar (Dehmer 2004, p. 113, n. 113). The edifice—redesigned in the sixteenth century—still exists. The contents would have been removed under the Napoleonic suppression of religious orders. When the banner was acquired by the Museum in 1913, only one side was visible, since the canvas had been relined (coincidentally, the same thing happened to Romanino’s banner in the Museum); however, on the basis of Cavalcaselle’s description, Frank Jewett Mather recognized what it was and surmised the presence of the Flagellation on the reverse side. X-ray examination confirmed this, but only in 1950 was the relining canvas removed, making the Flagellation visible (Gardner 1972). Remarkably, the picture surface of both sides is in very good condition, though—as noted above—the border has been lost through trimming. The banner is generally dated to about 1395, which means that it was painted after Spinello’s frescoes in the Camposanto in Pisa (1390–91) and is about contemporary with the elaborate altarpiece he undertook for the Pisan cathedral (main panel in the Harvard Art Museums). It predates Spinello’s extensive fresco cycle in the Palazzo Pubblico of Siena (1407–8). Spinello maintained a workshop in his native Arezzo and the banner was probably painted there.Keith Christiansen 2012",

        "Intro Description": "This rare double-sided painting was commissioned by the Confraternity of Saint Mary Magdalen and would have been carried in religious processions. On one side the members of the confraternity (hooded so their charitable acts would remain anonymous) kneel before their patron saint. On the reverse is the Flagellation of Christ. The face of Christ is a photographic facsimile of the original painted face, which was detached in the nineteenth century and is now in the Camposanto Teutonico, Rome.",
