Water figures prominently in his imagery—notably, in his riverscapes painted from the vantage point of his studio-boat.This painting's flickering brushwork and lightened palette relate it to the works of the Impressionists, whose influence on Daubigny grew out of his contact with Pissarro and Monet in the 1860s and early 1870s.",

        "Notes": "These twelve panels are part of a larger series which was installed in a room of the Palazzo di San Martino Gusnago (now Palazzo Pastore), near Ceresara, between Mantua and Brescia. The earliest known reference (Church 1884) to the panels mentions a total of forty-four, but three additional panels were apparently found subsequently (Conway 1914). The total number of panels is not completely certain. Besides the twelve in The Met, the following can be traced (some may be listed twice):6 in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London2 in the George D. and Harriet W.

        "Intro Description": "These twelve heads are from a series of at least forty-four panels that decorated the ceiling beams and upper walls of a small room in the palace of San Martino Gusnago, not far from Mantua. Whether they were commissioned by the military commander Francesco Secco or by Eusebio Malatesta, the Jewish advisor of Duke Federigo II Gonzaga, cannot be said. This type of ceiling decoration was especially popular in northern Italy. Only one of the figures can be identified with any likelihood: the one in the costume of a Venetian doge appears to be Marco Barbarigo (doge 1485–86). They were probably painted between 1500 and 1515 and in the insistent perspective of the architecture reveal the influence of the outstanding Milanese painter-architect Bramantino.",

        "Catalogue Entry": "From Paris to the Auvergne:Between 1826 and 1830 Rousseau studied in the Paris atelier of landscape painter Charles Rémond. As part of his curriculum he produced sketches and studies out of doors. This practice was well established in the decades that witnessed the rise of landscape as an independent genre of painting, a development ratified by the Academy of Fine Arts’s establishment of a Prix de Rome in the category of historical landscape painting (paysage historique). The prize was awarded every four years, beginning with Achille-Etna Michallon in 1817, followed by Rémond in 1821, and André Giroux in 1825. Laureates were entitled to spend four years at the Villa Medici, the Academy’s outpost in Rome.Rousseau competed unsuccessfully for the Prix de Rome in the spring of 1829. (The winner was Jean-Baptiste Gibert.) His immediate options for sketching outdoors continued to be limited to countryside relatively close to Paris, ranging north to the Forest of Compiègne and south to the Forest of Fontainebleau. He must have grown impatient to travel farther afield. By June 1830, the eighteen-year-old artist was in the Auvergne, a remote area of the Massif Central in south-central France that had recently grown in popularity among landscape painters for its rugged, mountainous terrain. Rousseau’s biographer Alfred Sensier provided a general itinerary: Thiers and Royat in volcanic area of Puy de Dome, then south to the Cantal region to explore the valleys of Thiézac and Saint-Vincent, Falgou, the Roches de Macbey, and the banks of the river Cère, taking in the ruined castles of Recoule and Muret.[1] Some fifty studies from the Auvergne trip, encompassing drawings and oil sketches, are known.[2]The Painting:The Auvergne gave rein to Rousseau’s ongoing affinity for the panoramic vista, a format to which the young artist was already partial (see, for example, The Met32.100.133]. New, however, was the opportunity to gain high ground and survey dramatic landscape from above—to revel in plunging, bird’s-eye views, as he evidently did when he painted the present work. The centerpiece of this study is a hamlet nestled at the base of a steep cliff among undulating, swelling hills. With its swathes of red volcanic stone and the ruined château de Murol piercing the sky at the far right, the site has been identified tentatively as the plateau of the Dent du Marais.[3]Rousseau scanned the landscape not only laterally but longitudinally, recording its exaggerated topography faithfully. The irregularity of the scenery forced the artist to approach it with fresh eyes and an off-the-cuff technique. He began by laying in the composition with thinned, ruddy brown paint. From the outset he was attentive to nuances of light and shade, applying the medium more heavily to signify pools of shadow beneath the mottled sky. This brown layer was left broadly exposed. Responsive not only to the land and its physical features but also to fleeting atmospheric conditions, Rousseau selectively added a range of greens: vibrant and bodied for fields exposed to direct sunlight, mellower where it is applied thinly over the initial brown lay-in, and mixed with gray to indicate shadow in the distance. Rock faces and stone cottages, glinting here and there in the sun, were rendered in grays, their solid forms appropriately built up with impasted paint.A Hamlet in the Auvergneconveys the thrill of personal discovery, of witnessing the vast prospect for the first time. The sense of awe it embodies is akin to that experienced by the early Renaissance humanist Petrarch (1304–1374), whose watershed ascent of Mont Ventoux in Provence prompted him “to look about me and see what we had come to see.” The sheer number and variety of studies Rousseau produced in the Auvergne—this is one of the largest—make clear that he enjoyed his climbs, the views they afforded, and adapting his technique to the specific character of each site.[4]Rousseau Returns to Paris, 1830 and After:Rousseau’s contemporary, the art writer Théophile Silvestre, wrote: “This journey of six months in 1830 was his own little revolution.”[5] There is no precise account of Rousseau’s return to Paris, but Sensier makes clear that the young painter could no longer square his ambitions with being Rémond’s follower: “Rémond anathematized him . . . and thought his landscapes the product of delirium . . . .”[6] Later in life, Rousseau denied that Rémond had influenced his early development, but Sensier’s brief statement implies that Rousseau remained in contact with his former teacher until at least the end of 1830. If Rémond did harbor reservations about Rousseau’s virtuosic plein-air studies, which is debatable, it is difficult to see why. Perhaps more telling is a comparison with Rousseau’s first submission to the Salon,Paysage; site d’Auvergnein 1831. The painting is generally thought to be the one now known asHilly Landscape with an Angler(see fig. 1 above), apaysage composé, in which the artist synthesized motifs he had recorded in his plein-air sketches. Its gauzily painted forms stand in sharp contrast to Auvergnat scenery as depicted in the elder painter’s heroic landscapes, one example of which isLes Sources de Royat (Cascade de Royat)(fig. 2).Whatever the precise circumstances surrounding Rousseau’s new independence, the young artist soon found a champion in the influential history painter Ary Scheffer (1795–1858), who placed a selection of Rousseau's Auvergne sketches on view in his studio. It is possible, but by no means certain, that the present sketch was among them. One result of Scheffer’s support was to stimulate interest in Rousseau, who would become a leading figure of the Romantic generation, and who attracted patronage from the highest levels of the Orléans regime.A Hamlet in the Auvergneand the Romantic Landscape:Consistent with then-current classifications, Rousseau considered works such asA Hamlet in the Auvergneto be studies (études) rather than finished paintings (tableaux). There is no painting corresponding to this study, but it—or a memory of the view itself—was the probable point of departure for a watercolor,Auvergne Landscape(fig. 3). One of the great French landscape watercolors of the Romantic era, the view is broader than the one in the oil and the point of view has shifted up and to the left, resulting in a more poeticized image. The vaporous mist contributes to the effect, as do waterfalls cascading over the cliffs; their graphic qualities assume a pictorial role equal to what they portray. The sheet’s unusually elaborate medium (watercolor and pastel with gouache heightening, possibly with touches of gum arabic) and technique strongly suggest that it was not executed in an improvised setting out of doors—not entirely—but afterward, in the artist’s studio. Rousseau did not employ watercolor often, and the exceptional, even experimental nature of this work almost certainly echoes the personal impact of the initial experience as expressed in the oil.Rousseau’s studies reflect a reorientation of man’s relationship to nature. The change began during the Enlightenment, when artists and others set out to experience nature firsthand as a means of gaining knowledge, and continued in the Romantic era, when they sought to translate this experience into correspondingly poetic works of art. This shift can be gauged by comparingHamlet in the Auvergnewith the Louvre watercolor, and is alluded to in one of Rousseau’s often-quoted remarks: “The tree which rustles and the heather which grows are for me the grand history, that which will not change. If I speak well their language, I shall have spoken well the language of all times.”[7] Both pictures convey the epic scale of nature as Rousseau experienced it, but there are parallels in works by his Romantic peers. It is evident, for example, in Paul Huet’s views of Rouen in watercolor (fig. 4) and in oil (fig. 5), and also in Alexandre-Gabriel Decamps’spaysage historiquedepictingMarius Defeats the Cimbrians(fig. 6).[8]A Hamlet in the Auvergnemay have been included in the auction of fifty-five studies and finished paintings sold by the artist in 1850. More certain is that it was acquired, albeit at an unknown date, by the Norman marine painter Charles Mozin (1806–1862), whom Rousseau met in Rouen in the fall of 1831. The red wax seal of the Mozin estate sale is affixed to the stretcher (fig. 7).[9]The Auvergne as a Destination for Artists:Rousseau’s decision to visit the Auvergne has often been regarded as unusual, but he was not the first artist to visit the region, nor the first to appreciate its wild aspect and rustic character. Michallon accompanied the L’Espine family to the spa town of Vichy in 1814. He may have stopped in the Auvergne again in 1817, on his way to Rome, where in 1818 he paintedWaterfall at Mont-Dore(The Met1994.376). His friend Rémond was there about the same time. Even before he paintedLes sources de Royat(fig. 2), Rémond had exhibited theEtude d’après nature à Royat (Puy-de-Dome)at the Salon of 1819 (whereabouts unknown), and in the same year he produced three views in and around Royat as lithographs.[10] At the Salon of 1822, Rémond showedCarloman, Mortally Wounded in the Forest of Yvelines, which, despite its purported setting in the vicinity of Paris, clearly takes place in a landscape inspired by the Auvergne.[11] It is not known how often Rémond returned to the Auvergne, but he was there not long before Rousseau’s visit, in 1828, as attested by a study (whereabouts unknown).[12] Rémond exhibited an Auvergne subject again at the Salon in 1831.[13] He also put up for sale thirteen Auvergnat subjects in an auction of his studies that he organized in 1842.[14]A large group of drawings produced by Étienne-Jean Delécluze on a tour of the Auvergne in 1821 suggests that he envisioned reproducing them as lithographs, as Rémond did.[15] This was the reason for Eugène Isabey’s sketching expedition to the Auvergne, undertaken at the behest of Baron Taylor and Charles Nodier for their epochal illustrated publicationVoyages pittoresques et romantiques dans l’ancienne France, issued in twenty-four volumes between 1820 and 1878. Isabey’s prints, produced between 1829 and 1831 and issued in 1833, typically show a village, church, or castle monumentalized within a mountainous setting, often by representing it from below (see, for example, The Met22.85.8), and although Rousseau produced such views as well, there is nothing likeHamlet in the Auvergneamong Isabey’s compositions.[16]Paul Huet visited the Auvergne in 1831. He and Rousseau undoubtedly compared notes on the region when they met in Rouen that fall. Perhaps Charles Mozin's interest in acquiring the present work originated in those conversations.[17]Asher Miller 2020[1] Alfred Sensier,Souvenirs sur Théodore Rousseau(Paris, 1872), pp. 20–23.[2] See Schulman 1999, nos. 24–81 (oils). Known drawings from the trip are fewer in number.[3] The identification is credited to Thierry Normand in Kurlander 2014.[4] This is among the two or three largest studies Rousseau produced in the Auvergne. Only Schulman no. 60, at 16 7/8 x 24 ¾ inches (43 x 63 cm), and no. 77, at 13 7/8 x 30 ¾ inches (35.3 x 52.7 cm), are comparable in size.[5] “Ce voyage de six mois, 1830, est sa petite revolution.” Théophile Silvestre, “L'oeuvre posthume de Théodore Rousseau,”Catalogue de la vente qui aura lieu suite du décès de Théodore Rousseau, sale catalogue, Hôtel Drouot, Paris, April 27–May 2, 1868, p. 8.[6] “Rémond l’anathémisa et le voua aux dieux infernaux: ses paysages étaient l’oeuvre du délire . . . .” Sensier 1872, p. 23.[7] Rousseau, as quoted by Charles Sprague Smith, inBarbizon Days: Millet-Corot-Rousseau-Barye(New York, 1902), p. 132.[8] The Huet watercolor (fig. 4) has also been attributed to Rousseau; see Michel Schulman with the collaboration of Marie Bataillès and Virginie Sérafino,Théodore Rousseau, 1812–1867: Catalogue raisonné de l’œuvre graphique(Paris, 1997), p. 111, no. 89 (see also the prior entry, no. 88, devoted to Rousseau’s large topographical drawing of Rouen now in the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam, inv. 1953.211). Huet executed the oil (fig. 5) in 1831 and exhibited it to general acclaim at the Salon of 1833; he produced it following the destruction of a forty-foot long painting of Rouen he had made for the Diorama Montesquieu, Paris, in the fall of 1829, which Rousseau is likely to have seen. See Pierre Miquel, “Paul Huet,”Le Paysage français au XIXe siècle, 1824–1874: L’École de la Nature(Maurs-la-Jolie, 1975), vol. 2, pp. 203–8. The Decamps (fig. 6) was exhibited at the Salon of 1834.[9] Rousseau reportedly encountered Huet in Rouen in 1831 as well, perhaps not for the first time.

        "Intro Description": "In 1830, the eighteen-year-old Rousseau set out on a sketching expedition in the rugged Auvergne region of central France that would change the course of landscape painting. From a high perch, the artist painted this panoramic view of an unidentified hamlet nestled at the base of a steep cliff among swelling hills. Upon his return to Paris, sketches like this one were celebrated by leading figures of the Romantic generation, establishing Rousseau’s reputation. The French countryside took its place as the equal of Italy’s, with the frankness of touch seen here becoming the vernacular idiom for representing it in paint.",

        "Catalogue Entry": "According to legend, Romulus—having settled Rome with his warrior followers—attempted to negotiate marriages for them with the neighboring Sabine tribe. When this failed he organized a festival as a ruse and invited the Sabines to attend. He is shown at the left raising the hem on his cloak in a pre-arranged signal to his men, each of whom will carry off one of the Sabine maidens, bringing her back to Rome to provide the great city with future generations. The story is told by Plutarch (Life of Romulus, XIV) as well as Livy and Virgil.Long considered a defining masterpiece of French classical painting, this work was produced in Rome for the maréchal Charles I de Créquy (d. 1638), whose collection also included Caravaggio'sThe Musicians(The Met52.81). A second, quite different, treatment of the theme is in the Musée du Louvre, Paris. The chronological relationship of the two pictures was long a matter of debate. For example, Mahon (1960) saw The Met's variant as earlier, dating it between 1634 and 1635, and placing the Paris picture about 1637–38, while Blunt (1960) considered The Met's example later, from about 1637, and dated the Louvre version 1635. We now know that the New York painting is the earlier of the two. It appeared in Créquy's posthumous inventory and must have been painted about 1633–34, when he served as ambassador in Rome. More recently (Sparti 2006) the discovery of a receipt dated 1635 forThe Destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem(Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna), a painting long associated stylistically (by Blunt and Mahon among others) with the Louvre work, further suggests that the two pictures may have been produced in more or less the same time period, hatching in the artist's mind as compositional and expressive alternatives.Poussin experimented with compositional variations in a number of preliminary drawings. Spatial and figural ideas for both paintings appear in drawings in the Uffizi, Florence, and the collection of the Dukes of Devonshire, Chatsworth, both dated about 1633–34 by Rosenberg and Plat (1994). Two drawings in the Royal Collection, Windsor Castle, apparently studies for the New York composition, are dated about 1633 by Clayton (1995). Finally, Poussin's drawing from the early 1630s of Hercules and Antaeus (Ambrosiana Library, Milan) should be mentioned. An illustration for Leonardo da Vinci's  treatise on painting, which greatly interested Poussin, it is closely related to one of the Windsor Castle drawings,Nude Man Lifting Up a Woman.For the key figures of his New York composition Poussin borrowed motifs from a number of classical and classicizing sculptures, including the Roman statue of a Gaul Killing Himself and His Wife (The Ludovisi Gaul) in the Palazzo Altemps, Rome, and Giambologna's 1583 sculpture group of the subject (Rape of a Sabine Woman) in the Loggia dei Lanzi, Florence, as well as from Pietro da Cortona's 1625 painting,Rape of the Sabinesin the Capitoline Museum, Rome. Poussin's knowledge of the architecture of Vitruvius and Serlio is apparent in the settings of both variants.Blunt (1966) sites four copies of this composition in early sales and inventories, but it is not always possible to tell which version is referred to. A copy of The Met's painting was in the Warschaw Collection, Los Angeles, in 1971, and a variation of the composition made by Poussin's friend, the painter Jacques Stella, is in the Princeton Art Museum. Jean Audran engraved The Met's composition in reverse.[Mary Sprinson de Jesús 2010]",

        "Frame": "The frame is from France and dates to about 1660–70 (see figs. 1–4 above). This extremely fine Louis XIV carved frame is made of walnut and constructed with mitred corners secured with tapered keys. The sight edge ornament is comprised of running acanthus leaves and shells with a narrow fillet. A small hollow and step rises to a gentle ogee magnificently carved with twenty pairs of stylized Persian lions, their forelegs, wings, and lower bodies evolving into scrolling acanthus leaves. They face backward toward carved floral pairs in the form of roses, jonquils, daffodils, chrysanthemums, sunflowers, and lilies and flank a heart-shaped shield. Fully articulated acanthus leaves span each corner while the hollow at the outside terminates with dentil carved flutes and husks at the back edge. The frame is thought to be made for the painting when it was in the collection of the duchesse d’Aiguillon for le Petit Luxembourg in Paris. The extremely skillful later gilding on its thin gesso layer with an even more recent heavy ochre toner layer may date from the eighteenth or nineteenth century during ownership by the Hoare family at Stourhead, Wiltshire, UK.Timothy Newbery with Cynthia Moyer 2017; further information on this frame can be found in the Department of European Paintings files",
        "Intro Description": "This painting embodies Poussin’s innovations derived from studying Roman antiquity. Figural groups, several closely based on ancient sculptures, evoke the choreography of dancers caught mid-action on stage, while the complex interplay of drapery woven between the figures reveals Poussin as a master colorist. Poussin arranged wax figures in a tiny, theater-like box to establish the sophisticated spatial relationships and formal balance of such paintings. The violent subject comes from a founding myth for the city of Rome: Romans invited the neighboring Sabines to a festival with the intention of forcibly capturing their women as wives. When the Roman leader Romulus raised his cloak—seen here at left—his warriors seized them. This painting belonged to the French ambassador to Rome in the 1630s and then to King Louis XIII’s chief minister, Cardinal Richelieu.",

        "Catalogue Entry": "Little is known about Frederick Waters Watts, often mistakenly called William Watts, a landscape painter and follower of Constable. It seems likely that he is the William Watts who, according to the records of the Royal Academy schools, entered at seventeen in 1817 and won silver medals in 1819, 1820, and 1821. He exhibited at the Royal Academy, the British Institution, and the Society of British Artists before ceasing to paint in about 1860.Formerly attributed to Constable, this painting was assigned to William Watts by Turner (1913). The Museum formally changed its attribution to Federick Waters Watts in 1935. Reynolds (1984) and Fleming-Williams and Parris (1984) affirmed that the canvas is by F. W. Watts and identified the subject, noting that there is a drawing (Victoria and Albert Museum, London) by Constable of the same bridge inscribed “Hendon 8 Oct. 1820.” A painting by the same hand as that in The Metropolitan Museum and of the same subject but from a more distant viewpoint is in the John G. Johnson Collection of the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Fleming-Williams and Parris published a third version (location unknown) that is also a more distant view but without the large tree in the left foreground of the Philadelphia picture.There is no way of knowing which, if any, of these three pictures was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1828 as \"An old bridge at Hendon, Middlesex\" by F. Watts, though Fleming-Williams and Parris think it was most likely this work. Even if not, the canvas is an early one and may date to about 1828. It is in very fine condition and is marked by the artist’s highly particularizing descriptive technique. The brickwork that is shown at the end of the old bridge in Constable’s 1820 drawing seems to have been shored up and squared off by 1828, as depicted in all three views by Watts. The stumps of trees on the bank to the left and in the middle of the stream are visible in the paintings and the drawing as well.[2012; adapted from Baetjer 2009]",

        "Intro Description": "A follower of John Constable, Watts exhibited widely as a landscapist but ceased painting around 1860. The site of this work, Hendon, is part of suburban London today, but in Watts’s time it was still quite rural and attracted painters in search of rustic views. Watts's depiction is enlivened by small yet attentively depicted figures: passersby on the bridge, a wader in the stream, and a dog at the water’s edge. This painting is thought to have been exhibited at the Royal Academy in London in 1828.",

        "Catalogue Entry": "The Artist:For a biography of Domenico Fetti, see the Catalogue Entry forThe Parable of the Mote and the Beam(1991.153).The Painting:Derived from a series first commissioned by Duke Ferdinando I Gonzaga (1587–1626), this painting represents one of the most famous parables found in the Bible, that of the Good Samaritan relayed in the Gospel of Luke 10:25-37. A lone traveler was robbed, beaten, and left for dead along the road to Jericho. After a Jewish priest and then a Levite ignored the suffering man, a Samaritan came upon him and showed him mercy: “He went to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. Then he put the man on his own donkey, brought him to an inn and took care of him.”As with Fetti’s other parables, Northern compositions influenced the interpretation. A print after Henrich Aldegrever (ca. 1502–1555/1561) (The Met17.3.1381) contains many of the key aspects of Fetti’s figural group including the Samaritan’s powerful, striding legs, the beaten figure’s head turned toward the viewer, and the fall of his legs across the donkey. A key innovation of Fetti’s was to reduce the Samaritan’s features to an elegant turban (eliminating his face altogether) while focusing attention on the limp victim’s expression, his exhausted eyes elegantly engaging the viewer.Around 1619, Fetti began a series of twelve compositions illustrating the parables of Christ and two related subjects of proverbs for the Mantuan court (for more details, see 1991.153).[1] Fetti and his studio produced many copies of these celebrated images, and the composition ofThe Good Samaritanproved especially popular, sparking the greatest number of compositional variants and copies.[2] The Met’s painting is unlikely to be the prime version and was likely produced in his workshop but not by his hand. The prime version is generally accepted to be a horizontal format panel, formerly in the imperial collections of Prague and now in the Gemäldegalerie, Dresden, executed in sparkling colors with an inclusion of ruins in the middle distance (see fig. 1 above).[3] If this is, indeed, Fetti’s earliest articulation of the theme, then his composition is even more strongly linked with Aldegrever’s print, with its horizontal format and architectural landscape. The difference in format begs the question of whether Fetti’s decorative series may have developed in tandem with independent easel paintings of his parable subjects from its inception. A second painting, which has sometimes been considered the prime version and utilizes an identical, central figural group in the vertical format of the Gonzaga series, is today in the Gallerie dell’Accademia, Venice (fig. 2). It is this basic format that is found in The Met’s composition and in a more finely finished panel in the Museo Thyssen-Bornemisza, Madrid. While some scholars have taken this difference of technique to indicate that The Met’s painting comes from a later stage in Fetti’s development, Sadfarik considers it to be evidence of another hand, probably someone in Fetti’s workshop.[4] At least ten additional variants and copies are documented between public collections and the art market.[5]The composition of Fetti’sThe Good Samaritanhad a lasting appeal among artists and connoisseurs through the end of the nineteenth century. A close copy of The Met’s painting descended from the collection of the theorist of the picturesque, Richard Payne Knight (1751–1824).[6] A somewhat simplified, red chalk drawing of the vertical composition passed through a series of great collectors—including Jonathon Richardson Senior (1667–1745) and Antoine-Joseph Dezallier d’Argenville (1680–1765)—though it is anomalous as a preparatory work on paper for Fetti’s series.[7] Artists’ continued interest in treating the formal and emotional power of interlocked figures in a landscape can be traced through Vincent Van Gogh (1853–1890)’s copy of Eugène Delacroix (1798–1863)’s related composition (fig. 3).David Pullins 2020[1] Askew 1961.[2] Askew 1961, p. 37.[3] Among the replicas of this painting is a horizontal format version, thought to be autograph, in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.[4] The shifting degrees of certainty with which The Met painting has been given to Fetti—from full confidence in the early twentieth century to later hesitation, notably by Safarik 1990, pp. 102, 105—can be traced in the References section of this entry.[5] At least twelve versions and copies have survived.

        "Catalogue Entry": "This beautiful and moving picture was acquired in 1908 by one of Bellini’s most eloquent admirers, the great British critic Roger Fry (1866–1934), who was employed by the Museum at the time (see Fry 1908). Despite its exceptional quality it has sometimes been thought to have been painted with workshop assistance (see, for example, Goffen 1989), which seems most unlikely. To judge from the number of works that bear Bellini’s signature or are painted in a style closely related to his, he must have run an extensive, efficient, and busy workshop in which successive generations of artists were tained. However, in most cases a distinct variation in quality is apparent and examination of workshop paintings with infrared reflectography invariably reveals the use of a cartoon or tracing from another work. For example, in the very beautifulMadonna and Child with Saints Paul and Georgein the Galleria dell’Accademia, Venice, it has been convincingly observed that an assistant painted the central figures of the Madonna and Child from a cartoon or tracing from another work in the same museum, the so-calledMadonna degli Alberetti(dated 1487), while the accompanying saints are of higher quality and must be autograph. In another picture, the beautifulMadonna and Childin the Accademia Carrara, Bergamo, the landscape is uncharacteristic of Bellini’s autograph work and is likely to have been painted by an extremely talented assistant. Two works in The Met offer further evidence of the ways in which Bellini organized his workshop. In a small devotional painting of the Madonna and Child (49.7.2), the landscape, which incorporates features from a well-known painting in the National Gallery, London (theMadonna of the Meadow), is superior to the figures and the picture may well have been the product of a collaboration between two workshop assistants, one of whom was particularly gifted in the painting of landscapes. In another painting (49.7.1)—an imposing picture of the Madonna and Child with saints that must have been a commission of some importance—the painting of the figures varies in quality and examination of the work with infrared reflectography shows a combined use of tracing from a cartoon and free-hand drawing; some of the figures were clearly derived from other compositions by Bellini (for more detailed information, see the relevant online entry). None of these qualitative distinctions pertain to the painting catalogued here, the quality of which is entirely characteristic of Bellini’s finest work. Examination of the picture with infrared reflectography has revealed an extensive, free-hand preparatory drawing, fully modeled, with clear demarcations for those areas intended to be most strongly lit; this type of drawing is typical of Bellini’s autograph works (for a discussion of this drawing and of Bellini’s workshop practice, see Christiansen 2004; and for Bellini’s practice, in general, Giovanni Villa, \"L’arte della ricerca, il primato del disegno: ‘L’altra luce’ di Giovanni Bellini,\" inGiovanni Bellini, exh. cat., Rome, 2008, pp. 39–51).As noted by Robertson (1968), the treatment of the light is particularly beautiful and the landscape looks ahead to his paintings of the first decade of the sixteenth century. The closest analogies for the figure style are to be found in two altarpieces Bellini painted in 1488: one for the church of the Frari in Venice and the other for S. Pietro Martire, Murano.The child holds a quince as a symbol of Redemption and the landscape too seems to allude to the theme of death and Resurrection: the trees are barren in the foreground and the fields fallow, while in the background all is green (the effect is somewhat exaggerated as some of the brownish color in the middle ground is due to the copper resonate green having altered with time). The path leading from the town to the barren foreground is a motif found in many of Bellini’s paintings and may be intended to suggest the journey of the life of the soul (on this theme see Augusto Gentili, \"Bellini and Landscape,\" in Peter Humfrey, ed.,The Cambridge Companion to Giovanni Bellini, Cambridge, 2004, pp. 167–81).A later variant of The Met's picture was sold in Genoa in 2013 (formerly Cook collection, Richmond); another is in the Harrach Gallery, Vienna.Keith Christiansen 2014",

        "Frame": "The frame is Venetian and dates to about 1500 (see figs. 1–4 above). This water gildedcassettaor box frame, though simple in form, is extravagantly ornamented on its frieze with rounded-end, blue-painted panels at the corners and centers. The scrolling foliate vines are executed using the sgraffito technique by scratching through the paint to reveal the gold surface below. The scrollwork passages in between are carried out in a dragon’s blood transparent glaze and appear reddish in tone. A slight, but clever, reduction in size was carried out on the frieze by cutting at the center blue panels’ curved ends. A slip liner has been added to the sight edge to reinforce earlier damage.Timothy Newbery with Cynthia Moyer 2015; further information on this frame can be found in the Department of European Paintings files",

        "Intro Description": "Separated from our everyday world by a parapet, the Madonna nonetheless draws the viewer in with her gaze. A cloth of honor, a rich textile often displayed behind her, has been pulled aside to reveal a distant landscape, where we witness the transition from dormant to verdant nature—a metaphor, like the dawn sky, for death and rebirth. The asymmetrical composition looks ahead to the work of Titian. When Albrecht Dürer visited Venice, he met Bellini, then in his seventies, and declared him \"still the best in the art of painting.\"The fine Venetian frame is of the period.",

Bache (1861–1944). It recalls the many head studies of anonymous young models by Flemish painter Michiel Sweerts (1618–1664), but most scholars today associate the painting with Bourdon, a French painter who studied in Rome.",

In the last full year of his life, 1769, demonstrating his continuing vitality in old age, he painted six mythologies, probably commissioned by Jean François Bergeret de Frouville (1719–1783), all on a similarly grand scale. The pair of paintings catalogued here came to light at the estate auction of baron Léopold Roslin d’Ivry (died 1883), and Alastair Laing has suggested that they may have been commissioned by Jean Marie Roslin, seigneur d’Ivry, for the family château at Hénonville. The seigneur d’Ivry was connected through his wife to Pierre Jacques Onésyme Bergeret de Grancourt (1715–1785), Jean-François’s older brother and one of Boucher’s most important patrons.All of the components of Boucher’s mature style in landscape are present here: deciduous trees that have the shape of Roman pines, pollarded willows, a bridge, a stream, a pool, a fountain, a thatched roof; cows, a donkey, sheep, dogs of indeterminate breed; and peasants whose stockings and colorful clothes are without tears or rents. Certainly the figures, especially the women, were not studied from life, for they had appeared with only slight variations in many other pictures over the years and Boucher would hardly have needed a model when painting them. His skill and technical facility are astonishing.Katharine Baetjer 2014",

        "Catalogue Entry": "The Painting:This compact, miniature altarpiece was commissioned for devotions to the Virgin of the Rosary.[1] The rosary refers to both the series of prayers recited, and the string of prayer beads used as a memory device. Dominik of Prussia, a fifteenth-century Carthusian monk, recommended that worship of the Virgin of the Rosary be split into fifty events from the lives of Christ and the Virgin, known as mysteries. One mystery was assigned to each Ave Maria prayer in a chaplet (one third of the full rosary). The further diffusion of the cult was largely due to the work of Alanus de Rupe, a Dominican monk who founded the Confraternity of the Psalter of the Glorious Mary in Douai around 1475. His followers continued the advancement of the cult, and the Fifteen Mysteries of the Rosary was first published inUnser Lieben Frawen Psalter, a devotional handbook dedicated to the Virgin, in 1483 in Ulm. Painted on a single panel that was later cut into sixteen parts (see Technical Notes), the fifteen mysteries presented in The Met's miniature altarpiece are divided into three registers of five images each: the five Joyful Mysteries (the Annunciation, the Visitation, the Nativity, the Presentation of Christ in the Temple, and the Finding of the Child in the Temple); the five Sorrowful Mysteries (the Agony in the Garden, the Scourging of Christ, the Mocking of Christ, Christ Carrying the Cross, and the Crucifixion); and the five Glorious Mysteries (the Resurrection, the Ascension, the Descent of the Holy Spirit, the Dormition of the Virgin, and the Coronation of the Virgin).The lower portion of the painting shows the Virgin of the Rosary as Queen of Heaven. She stands on a tiled floor below a baldachin, and carries the Christ Child, who holds the end of a chaplet represented as a garland of roses. This garland consists of fifty white roses, separated into groups of ten, or decades, interspersed with five larger red roses. Like the beads of a hand-held rosary, each smaller rose represents an Ave Maria prayer (Hail Mary), and each larger one a Paternoster (Our Father). The Child raises his right hand in blessing to a kneeling gentleman, who is under attack from three men in armor, and near whose head a branch with three white roses emerges. This represents a miracle associated with the rosary, where a man was saved from his attackers when he knelt and prayed, and the Virgin of the Rosary appeared.[2]  Each Ave Maria he recited became a rose, which the Virgin wove into a garland. Although the armor of the attackers is somewhat archaic, the kneeling figure wears contemporary clothing, which may indicate that his likeness is that of the donor of the painting. To the left of the Virgin kneels Saint Dominic who, due to a mistake of identification with Dominic of Prussia, was traditionally associated with the rosary cult. He is identified by his attribute, a dog with a burning torch in his mouth. Behind the saint kneels a pope, an emperor, and a king, who together represent the Christian Estates. Their appearances are somewhat generic, but it is possible that they are meant to represent the contemporary Leo X, Maximilian I, and a young Charles V, respectively.Bauman (1989) related the iconography and composition of this multi-scene picture with a somewhat obscure Spanish woodcut, signed and dated by Brother Francisco Doménech in 1488. It is the only known print that relates closely with the imagery of The Met painting. A modern impression can be found in the Museum's collection (57.526).[3] This print shows the same arrangement of the fifteen mysteries in three groups of five, above a similar scene of the Virgin of the Rosary flanked by the Christian Estates and the miracle of the nobleman who prayed the rosary.The background landscape of the bottom scene of The Met's altarpiece accurately depicts the park, orWarande(pleasure grounds), of the Coudenberg palace of the dukes of Brabant in Brussels as it appeared in the early sixteenth century. At the upper left corner is the then-collegiate church of Saint Gudula in Brussels—later the Cathedral of Saints Michael and Gudula. This accurate depiction corresponds with a sketch of the area made by Albrecht Dürer probably on August 27 or 28, 1520, in Brussels, during his sojourn to the Netherlands in 1520–21 (Akademie der bildenden Künste, Kupferstichkabinett, Vienna; see fig. 1 above).[4] The drawing is monogrammed and dated, and it carries Dürer’s inscription:Dz ist zw prüssel der dirgartn und die lust dindn aws dem schlos hinab zw sehn(This is the game park and pleasure grounds in Brussels looking out from the back of the palace). Such a view from an upper window of the palace, depicted in both the drawing and the painting, suggests a privileged connection of each artist with the ducal court. The painting also indicates a particular relationship with the Dominicans and with the cult of the Virgin of the Rosary. Bauman suggested a possible candidate for the patron of the painting as one of the lords of the Ravensteyn, a prestigious family of Brussels, who had given the Dominicans the part of their hôtel that was contiguous with the Dominican convent and church, established in 1464 (Bauman 1989; Sintobin 1998). He noted that Adolf of Cleves, lord of Ravensteyn (1425–1492), grandson of John the Fearless and nephew of Philip the Good, commissioned stained-glass windows for the Dominican church. Furthermore, his son Philip (ca. 1459–1527) built a chapel in the church in 1524 that served as a mausoleum for himself and his wife.Such small-scale, multi-scene ensembles of the life of Christ and the Virgin are known in both manuscript illumination, such as Simon Bening’sStein Quadriptych,[5]  and panel paintings such as theTriptych with Scenes from the Life of Christby a Bruges Follower of Hans Memling (formerly with the dealer Rob Smeets, Milan) or theAltarpiece of the Life of Jesusby an anonymous Dutch master (Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam).[6]  The original framing of the ensemble no longer exists, eliminating any technical evidence that The Met altarpiece once had wings, perhaps with devotional texts or prayers. However, this possibility cannot be excluded.The Attribution and Date:Although originally attributed to Hans Memling (Lefort 1878 and Provenance), some scholars subsequently identified the artist as Goswijn (also spelled Goswin or Goossen) van der Weyden, a grandson of the celebrated Netherlandish painter Rogier van der Weyden. Held (1943) was the first to suggest this identification when he compared the scenes in the ensemble to Goswijn’s style, and the millefleur ground cover in the bottom section to the artist’s 1507Triptych of Abbot Antonius Tsgrooten(Koninklijk Museum voor Schone Kunsten, Antwerp; fig. 2). Supporting this attribution, Bauman (1989) proposed a stylistic similarity to Goswijn’sCrucifixion Triptychof about 1517 (D’Amour Museum of Fine Arts, Springfield, Massachusetts; fig. 3). However, the figures in The Met painting show more relaxed and natural poses than the stiff postures of those in the 1507 Antwerp altarpiece and are nothing like the elongated body proportions and proto-Antwerp Mannerist, agitated draperies of the 1517 Springfield triptych. Moreover, although painted rapidly and with great assurance (see Technical Notes), the rather bland, generalized facial types of all the figures in theVirgin of the Rosarydo not match the more individualized treatment and expressions of the heads in the other two paintings.The oeuvre of Goswijn has been reconsidered in recent years in relationship to the tradition of Rogier van der Weyden in Brussels, and due to the acquisition of the Saint Dymphna Altarpiece by the Phoebus Foundation in Antwerp.[7] Annick Born and Maximiliaan Martens note a heterogeneous style, and Matthijs Ilsink cites the absence of a signature style in Goswijn’s (Goosen’s) works.[8] In any event, the characteristics of the paintings attributed to Goswijn are not matched by The Met altarpiece. This is in regard not only to questions of style, but also of working procedures.[9] Technical examination so far of a number of the panels attributed to Goswijn reveal a very thorough underdrawing, not only for the composition, but also for the modeling of the figures.[10] The MetVirgin of the Rosarypaintings, by contrast, show no perceptible underdrawing (see Technical Notes).Although Goswijn was born in Brussels, [11] his career post-1492 was in Lier and then in Antwerp where he served as the dean of the painters’ guild in 1514 and 1530. He apparently had little to do with Brussels where it is far more likely that The Met ensemble was painted. As W. R. Valentiner noted in a February 26, 1943 certificate,  The Met paintings appear closer to the style of Bernard van Orley. In fact, they are not so distant from other scenes of Christ’s Passion of around 1520 from the circle of Van Orley in The Met’s collection —Four Scenes from the Passion(41.190.14). TheFifteen Mysteries of the Virgin of the Rosaryshare the diminutive, manuscript-illumination-like scale and the general palette dominated by reds, blues, purples, and yellows of the Van Orley follower’s scenes. However, the former does not adopt the more energetic poses and fluttering draperies influenced by Antwerp Mannerism of the latter.  Typical of Van Orley, as is true of the painter of theVirgin of the Rosary, is the influence of Albrecht Dürer’s prints on his oeuvre.[13]  In the tight cropping of the scenes and the reduction of figures to those essential for the theme, the paintings in The Met altarpiece follow Dürer’s prints, namely those from theSmall Woodcut Passion(1511). TheAnnunciation,[14]  theResurrection, and theAscensionserved as models for our painter, who adapted Dürer’s compositions (notably deleting the foreground Apostle in theAscension; see19.73.173,1975.653.51, and1975.653.56). A date of about 1515–20 for theVirgin of the Rosaryaltarpiece is suggested by connections with Dürer’s prints from theSmall Woodcut Passionthat circulated throughout the Netherlands in those years and thereafter. Although we cannot yet attribute this altarpiece to a known artist, it is most likely that he worked in Brussels, perhaps in the circle of Van Orley.Maryan W. Ainsworth 2012, updated 2022[1] Acquired in 1984, this altarpiece was first fully researched and discussed in an article by Guy C. Bauman in theMetropolitan Museum Journalin 1989 (Bauman 1989). This entry presents a summary of Bauman’s findings concerning the iconography of the work as well as an alternative proposal to the attribution.[2] The thirteenth-century German legend in which Ave Marias are transformed into lilies is found in Franz Pfeiffer,Marienlegenden: Dichtungen des dreizehnten Jahrhunderts met erläuternden Sach-und Wort-Erklärungen, new ed., Vienna, 1863, pp. 105–9, no. xv, as in Bauman (1989), p. 140 and n. 13.[3] The copper plate for this print is preserved in the Chalcographie Royale de Belgique in Brussels, but all the extant impressions are modern.[4] For the related bibliography, see most recentlyDürer war hier, eine Reise wird Legende.

        "Technical Notes": "Support:Now existing as sixteen individual panels, these scenes were originally painted on a single panel—made of two oak boards—and only later divided. Comparison of the wood grain across individual panels and the location of the join and two splits confirmed this theory and suggested the original spacing of the scenes.[1] About 4–5 millimeters of wood appears to be missing between each small scene. In their initial state, on a single panel, the borders of the individual scenes would have been demarcated in some way, whether by painted or gilded borders on the panel itself, or an applied wooden framework. However, the cuts that divided the scenes are located directly at the edges of each composition, or even intersecting them slightly, removing any evidence of original demarcations. Estimating the spaces between the scenes also suggested the likely width of the borders: 4–5 millimeters at most, quite narrow for an applied wooden framework and more likely to have been painted or gilded directly on the panel.Whether the physical frame included a grid to divide the individual scenes or only framed the perimeter, it was apparently installed after the panel was painted. The wide lower scene retains its original edge at the bottom; there the ground extends to the edge of the panel, but the painted composition ends about 5–6 millimeters from the edge and does not include a barbe. All other perimeter edges are trimmed, removing any evidence. When nestled together at 4–5 millimeters intervals the rows of five scenes are nearly the exact width of the bottom panel, resulting in a compact display. The current, modern frame spaces them slightly further apart.The individual panels were all planed down on their reverses and cradled at an unknown date, possibly at the time of their division. The panels measure about 2–3 millimeters thick.Preparation:The panels were prepared with a whitish ground, likely containing chalk. Examination with infrared reflectography did not reveal any underdrawing.[2]Paint Layers:The paintings appear to have been executed with speed and confidence; there is a good deal of wet-in-wet handling evident throughout the scenes. Comparison of the painting technique in many of the heads reveals a formulaic approach, not surprising given the number of figures depicted. The artist relied heavily on white for modeling, particularly in the male figures, where the strategic use of bright highlights over a warm midtone defined the volumes of the faces and features (see figs. 4–5 above). The precise use of nearly-pure lead white is also apparent in the x-radiograph (fig. 6). Dark brown contour lines were also important for creating expression and form, in addition to some brown and other warm mid-tones for shading. In some figures, the artist used a more blended approach, easing transitions between highlight and midtone, but still working the often-thick paint in a wet-in-wet fashion and leaving discrete brushstrokes apparent (fig. 7). The fleshtones of the female figures tend to be even more blended and incorporate a broader distribution of lead white, likely from a desire to render smooth and fair complexions (fig. 8). All scenes appear to have been painted by the same hand.There are gilded details in many scenes, for haloes and the gilded rays, all created with what appears to be shell gold. Much of the gilding is slightly abraded and only apparent on close examination. Otherwise, the paintings are in generally fair condition, with only some minor surface defects, such as very small paint losses.Sophie Scully 2023[1] Alan Miller, Conservator, and Kristin Holder, Research Scholar, Department of Paintings Conservation, examined the panels and made these observations.[2] Infrared reflectography was acquired with an OSIRIS InGaAs near-infrared camera fitted with a 6-element, 150mm focal length f/5.6–f/45 lens; 900-1700nm spectral response, October 2022.",

        "Intro Description": "In the later Middle Ages, Christian worshippers began to use strings of beads, known as rosaries, to help them count off prayers in a set number and sequence. While praying, they meditated upon a series of events in the lives of Christ and the Virgin Mary known as the \"fifteen mysteries.\" This altarpiece depicts the mysteries as separate scenes, arrayed like rosary beads across the top three registers of the altarpiece. The larger image at the bottom shows the Virgin and Christ Child adorned with a garland of red and white roses in the form of an enormous rosary. The background landscape portrays the Coudenberg Palace in Brussels, suggesting that the picture was commissioned by a member of the Habsburg court.",

        "Catalogue Entry": "The Artist:During the last few decades, Bartolomeo Cavarozzi has emerged as one of the most fascinating followers of Caravaggio. Born in Viterbo, north of Rome, he was trained by a compatriot, Tarquinio Ligustri. His earliest known work, an altarpiece of Saint Ursula and her companions (1608) in the church of San Marco, Rome, gives little hint of the naturalism that marks his finest work. Among these must be counted a painting of Saint Jerome at his desk accompanied by two youthful angels, for which he was paid by the Medici in Florence in 1617 (see fig. 1 above). A work of extraordinary quality, with an emphasis on naturalistic description and optical verity, the picture marks the opening of a new, more modern phase of caravaggism.Some time prior to 1617, he obtained living quarters in the palace of Giovanni Battista Crescenzi, a Roman noble who, in addition to his pursuits in architecture and painting, established an academy so that, according to our primary source, the painter/biographer Giovanni Baglione, “day and night there would be the occasion for all to learn the difficulties of art; and sometimes he would have them copy from life and would look for something beautiful and curious—fruits, animals and other bizarre things—that could be found in Rome, and he gave these to those youths to draw so that they would become good masters, which actually happened” (…teneva Accademia tanto di giorno quanto di notte tempo, acciocché avessero tutti maggiore occasione d'apprendere le difficoltà dell'arte; et anche talvolta havea gusto di far ritrarre dal naturale et andava a prendere qualche cosa di bello e di curioso che per Roma ritrovavasi di frutti d'animali e d'altre bizzarrie e consegnavala a quei giovani che la disegnassero, solo perché divenissero buoni Maestri si come veramente adivenne). The importance of this focused activity is evident in the astonishingly rendered worm-eaten table in theSaint Jeromeno less than in the beautiful still life of a skull, books, and a crucifix arranged on it. Equally astonishing is the focused light and the study of its play over the various surfaces. All of this attention to detail speaks to an artist with an instinct for still life painting.In 1617, Cavarozzi accompanied Crescenzi to Spain, and returned to Rome in 1619. It was probably in Spain that he painted a remarkable work of Saint John the Baptist in the wilderness, in which the vine leaves and lamb are, again, marvelously rendered, with meticulous attention to texture and light (figs. 2–3). The quality of the picture is such that, like another painting of the Sacrifice of Isaac (private collection), it has been ascribed to Caravaggio.[1] Yet the poetics are quite different: there is an elegance and delicacy and an attention to detailed description and to surface effects, rather than an attempt to describe a psychological drama. This approach aligns Cavarozzi with Orazio Gentileschi rather than Caravaggio and reminds us that the history of caravaggism has many strands.Despite the exquisite still life elements in the pictures cited above, it remains a matter of contention whether Cavarozzi painted independent still lives or whether he collaborated with a specialist. Papi (see Refs.) has noted that in 1613, a “Bartolomeo” painted aTable with Fruitsthat was sold to the Altemps through Prospero Orsi, a painter/dealer who played a key role in promoting the work of Caravaggio. Indeed, at the same time that Orsi sold the work of Bartolomeo [Cavarozzi?] to the Altemps, he sold another still life ascribed to Caravaggio. Papi goes further in identifying Cavarozzi as the author of the finest group of still lifes painted in early seventeenth-century Rome, paintings usually ascribed to the so-called Master of the Acquavella Still Life (named after the dealer who once owned the key work).Upon Cavarozzi’s return from Spain, where his paintings introduced artists to the practice of Caravaggio, his work loses some of its quality. He repeated, almost ad nauseam, a fine composition of the Holy Family. The poetics of light and texture that made his earlier work so astonishing was substituted with a tendency toward academism—doubtless in response to the success of Bolognese artists such as Guido Reni, Domenichino, and Francesco Albani.The Picture:Distributed over the surface of the painting are ten bunches of grapes of different varieties, a branch laden with peaches, branches of figs, some cherries, a praying mantis, and three birds, identifiable as pied wagtails. The dimensions well exceed the common size of a still life painting and indicate a special function.The Attribution:The painting is one of the few still lifes that can be attributed with relative certainly to Bartolomeo Cavarozzi, who—as noted above—spent his formative years in the academy established by the noble-born Giovanni Battista Crescenzi for the purpose of studying from nature. The opulent vines that weave through the composition can be linked most closely to the extraordinary foliage in the upper-left corner of the painting of Saint John the Baptist in the Cathedral in Toledo, Spain (noted above). The author of the only monograph on the artist, Gianni Papi (see Refs.) believes The Met’s picture dates before Cavarozzi left for Spain in 1617 and is more or less contemporary withThe Lament of Aminta(private collection), a beautiful picture of two figures—a youth playing the recorder and a female with cymbals (fig. 4). On the table behind which they sit is a still life of grapes, an open music score and a violin. The Met’s painting testifies to Cavarozzi’s careful observation of nature: his impressive ability to handle the tonal qualities of the twisting and folding leaves, the smooth surfaces of the cascading bunches of grapes, and their sensual aspect and tactility. More than a mere still life, the picture is a quasi-scientific record of a variety of grapes and other fruits and thus reflects a moment when art and the natural sciences intersect. (Cassiano del Pozzo, one of the central figures in the study of the natural sciences promoted in the Accademia dei Lincei, owned a work by Crescenzi.) There is the suggestion in the format and varieties of grapes with the later work of Bartolomeo Bimbi (1648–1729), who painted still lives documenting the botanical collections of the Medici (fig. 5). The birds have been identified as pied wagtails, common to yards, gardens, and stone walls.Although bunches of grapes presented artists with a perfect vehicle to show their skill at capturing effects of light and surface textures, as a matter of course, an erudite seventeenth-century viewer would associate the painter’s success with an episode in Pliny the Elder’sNatural History, where the Greek painter, Zeuxis, depicted grapes with such realism that birds came down to peck at them (for more about this story, seeL.2016.26).Keith Christiansen 2019[1] On all of these works, see Gianni Papi,Bartolomeo Cavarozzi, Soncino, 2015.

        "Catalogue Entry": "The Artist:The painter and etcher Christian Wilhelm Ernst Dietrich, who frequently signed his name Dietricy, was born in 1712, the son of a Weimar court painter, from whom he received initial training. At the age of thirteen he became a pupil of the landscape painter Alexander Thiele in Dresden, and in 1730 Thiele presented him to Elector Friedrich August I of Saxony (King August II of Poland, d. 1733), who appointed him court painter the next year. He retained the position during the subsequent reign of Elector Friedrich August II (King August III), under whom Dresden became a major artistic capitol. From 1734 to 1741, Dietrich traveled in Germany and possibly to the Netherlands; later he briefly visited Italy for study (1743–44). Except for his stays in Freiberg and Meissen during the Seven Years War (1756–63), Dietrich’s locus of activity until his death in 1774 was Dresden, with its magnificent royal painting gallery and print cabinet. Dietrich served as inspector of the gallery from 1748, and later he became professor of landscape painting at the Dresden art academy.An enormously prolific artist, Dietrich was fervently admired in Germany and abroad for his ability to emulate any past or present style and to combine the manners of various masters in single works. That eclectic approach, which nineteenth-century criticism disparaged as lacking in inventiveness (thus consigning Dietrich to obscurity), was in great demand among contemporary collectors. It allowed the artist’s works to be seamlessly integrated into the dense hangings of eighteenth-century picture galleries, which typically displayed conglomerations of various schools of painting. The three pictures by Dietrich belonging to The Metropolitan Museum (see also71.142;85.9) demonstrate the range of his stylistic pluralism, drawing variously from the Dutch Golden Age, the Italian and Flemish Baroque, and the French Rococo, which were important sources of inspiration throughout his career.The Picture:The Museum’sAdoration of the Shepherds, painted in the 1760s (the last digit of the date is obliterated), is a late version of a popular subject that Dietrich treated repeatedly. It offers a clear example of Dietrich’s practice of amalgamating and, in the eyes of his contemporaries, improving his sources. The composition and motifs derive largely from a 1646 painting by a Rembrandt pupil (National Gallery, London), which Dietrich probably knew from a reproductive mezzotint by Louis Bernard (British Museum, London). Dietrich adapted the man, woman, and child who lean over the wood partition from a Rembrandt etching (Hind 273; see18.71). The leftward compositional flow and prominent cast shadows appear to have been inspired by a copy after anAdoration of the Shepherdsby Rubens that entered the royal gallery in Dresden in 1741 (inv. no. 994; see Ina Maria Keller,Studien zu den deutschen Rembrandtnachahmungen des 18. Jahrhunderts, Berlin, 1981, pp. 36–38; Michel 1984, p. 98). The sharply defined contrast of light and dark was likely influenced by Correggio’s DresdenNativity, which had graced the royal gallery since 1746.This particular treatment of the Adoration of the Shepherds theme appears to have been well-liked among Dietrich’s clientele, as several copies are known to exist. A nearly identical canvas by Dietrich in Parma (Galleria Nazionale) has been advanced as the prototype for the present work (Michel 1984, p. 87). Two other replicas are in private ownership (art market, Rome, 1960s; Nagel Auktionen, Stuttgart, December 8, 2000, no. 1189). Aside from the replicas, similar versions of the subject which are close in date are found in the Staatliche Kunsthalle, Karlsruhe (dated 1758), and in the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna (dated 1760). Although no pendant is known for The Met’s canvas or the associated replicas, Dietrich frequently paired his Adorations with a companion piece to facilitate symmetrical hanging on a gallery wall. The version in Vienna, for example, has a counterpart in anAnnunciation to the Shepherdsin the same collection.Joshua P. Waterman 2013",

        "Catalogue Entry": "Wood was born in Suffolk and entered the Royal Academy schools in 1785. His manuscript list of sitters, which is in the library of the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, shows that in the years from 1790 to 1808 he painted 1,211 miniatures. This list is of immense value for the study of the technique of late-eighteenth-century miniaturists. He gives details of the pigments and methods he used in each portrait and frequently appends a tracing which gives an outline of the sitter's features. Wood died in London.In his ledger the artist records as no. 5589 a copy he made in 1798 “from a bad crayon picture\" of Lord Edward Fitzgerald (1763–1798), brother to the duke of Leinster. He does not provide a tracing, and the size he gives (less than 72 x 57 mm) indicates that the entry does not refer to this work.[2016; adapted from Reynolds and Baetjer 1996]",

        "Catalogue Entry": "This panel and its pendant in the National Gallery of Ireland, Dublin (Portrait of Anna Splinter; NGI.267), were separated at the Amsterdam auction of the Daniel Hooft collection in 1860. According to the auction catalogue, the paintings had passed from the family of Slingelandt to that of Hooft. On the basis of this information and genealogical research, Ekkart (1992) identified the sitters and traced the pictures' continuous descent to the Hooft sale.Johan Hulshout was the son of Wouter Hulshout, a wine merchant in The Hague, and Margriete Rottermondt. The younger Hulshout studied law at the University of Leiden and, in 1650, became secretary to the Hoogheemraadschap van Rijnland, which supervised the regional system of canals, dikes, and dams. He held the post until his death in 1687 and was succeeded by his eldest son, Johannes Hulshout (1652–1713). In 1650, Hulshout married Anna Splinter (ca. 1630–1694), the daughter of a pharmacist and burgomaster in The Hague, Pieter Splinter, and his wife, Catharina van Onderwater. During the 1650s, the young couple lived in a rented house (now no. 51) on the Rapenburg in Leiden. In 1668, Hulshout purchased property from the city and built an imposing town house (now Rapenburg 8), which was probably designed by the prominent architect Pieter Post (1608–1669).The portraits may be dated on the basis of costume and hairstyles to the first few years of the Hulshouts' residence in the new house, that is, about 1670 or slightly later. Especially fashionable for the time is the man's elaborate lace collar ingros point de Venise. The collar and cuffs are extraordinarily detailed, with countless eyelets visible under magnification, and a painstaking use of highlights and shadows to suggest the relief of the lace pattern. These passages, which probably represent treasured items of the sitter's own attire, recall Arnold Houbraken's remark (seeDe Groote Schouburgh der Nederlantsche konstschilders en schilderessen, Amsterdam, vol. 3, 1721, p. 162) that Slingelandt would work for four to six weeks to describe a single band of lace.The garden architecture in both portraits bears a general resemblance to Post's designs; the archway in this picture recalls Slingelandt's admiration for the Renaissance architect Sebastiano Serlio (1475–?1553/55).[2016; adapted from Liedtke 2007]",

        "Catalogue Entry": "Allegorical Figure Representing Fortitude, together with three other oval paintings—Allegorical Figure Representing Prudence(43.85.21),A Virtue, Possibly Patriotism(43.85.22), andTemperance(43.85.23)—are detached frescoes, likely to have come from the Palazzo Valle-Marchesini-Sala in Vicenza. A group of other detached frescoes—Allegorical Figure Representing Metaphysics(43.85.13),Arithmetic(43.85.14),Geometry(43.85.15),Grammar(43.85.16), andVirtue and Abundance(43.85.12)—is known to have come from the Gallery of the palace, since traces of the detached frescoes were found in that room following a restoration campaign between 1983–86. The fourVirtuesshare the same recent provenance, from the collection of Grace Rainey Rogers, with the other paintings from the palace and it has, therefore, been suggested that they decorated the same building.The four detached frescoes have been wrongly believed to come from a villa on the Brenta canal (Morassi 1962), or a villa near Vicenza (Pallucchini 1968), or Villa Valier Bembo, known as La Chitarra (Precerutti Garberi 1968, Zeri and Gardner 1973). Enea Arnaldi’s 1779 guidebook of the sights of Vicenza describes in the palace of Count Giorgio Marchesini: \"the Gallery . . . painted in fresco by Girolamo Colonna for what concerns the architecture, and by Giovan Battista Tiepolo for the figures . . . there is furthermore a room with groups in painted bronze, with four overdoors\". It is possible that the fourVirtueswere the \"groups in painted bronze\" or the \"four overdoors\" described by Arnaldi in a room of the palace. It has been proposed that theVirtueswere originally in the Saletta del Tempo e della Verità, the room adjacent to the Gallery of the Marchesini Palace (Cova 1986, Menegozzo 1990).The frescoes in Palazzo Valle-Marchesini-Sala were commissioned in 1760 by Giorgio Marchesini (Chignola 2004). Giovanni Battista Tiepolo painted the figures, possibly with the assistance of his son Giovanni Domenico, and of Francesco Zugno. Girolamo Mengozzi Colonna, instead, produced the trompe l’oeil architectural background. The four ovals with theVirtueswere painted by Tiepolo’s workshop, maybe following designs by Giovanni Battista.Allegorical Figure Representing Fortitudeis accompanied by her standard attribute, a pyramid, to her right. The significance of the Greek inscriptions around the figure is unclear. Giorgio Marchesini was a well-known Mason, and his palace was used as a Masonic temple in the late 1730s. It has been suggested (Menegozzo 1990) that the entire cycle of frescoes by Tiepolo at Palazzo Marchesini may have a Masonic significance.Another four overdoors with theContinents(The Met43.85.17,43.85.18,43.85.19,43.85.20) are said to come from another room in the same palace, but their presence there is not documented.Xavier F.

        "Intro Description": "While two mercenaries cast bullets and a third, seated behind them, seems to be inspecting one, others engage in revelry and a man and woman converse. Despite these apparent incongruities, the meticulous painting technique renders the scene convincing. Gérôme traveled to Egypt many times from 1855 onward. His recollections of these journeys, together with objects that he brought back to Paris, became ingredients for scenes which today might be regarded as historical fictions. The title of this work derives from the stock book of Gérôme’s dealer, who bought the painting from the artist in 1884, presumably soon after he finished it.",

        "Catalogue Entry": "The panel, dated 1668, was painted in the artist's native Rotterdam during the period in which he lived in immediate proximity to a Catholic \"hidden church\"—indicating that the artist himself was Catholic. Hondius treated a number of New Testament themes in the 1660s and later, some about this scale and others much larger. On the whole, such works were obviously intended for Catholic patrons. Although the subject of this picture would have had broad appeal in the Netherlands, where religious disputes were common, the nimbus around Christ's head, the halo over his mother's head, and the emphasis given to Mary and Joseph may be described as Catholic iconography.Luke (2:41–51) relates that the twelve-year-old Jesus entered the Temple of Jerusalem and engaged its learned elders in theological debate. After three days of searching, Mary and Joseph discovered their precocious son. Like other Dutch artists, Hondius treats the doctors as fools, a sure sign of which is hilarious headgear. The large volumes hauled down from the bookcase in the right background will be to no avail.The monumental architecture is conceived in a contemporary classical style like that often depicted by Bartholomeus van Bassen (ca. 1590–1652). The dog in the foreground is a typical, if unexplainable, motif in religious pictures by Hondius.[2016; adapted from Liedtke 2007]",

        "Catalogue Entry": "The Artist:Michele Desubleo (1602–1676) was born in Maubeuge in what was then the Spanish Netherlands and is today northern France. He seems to have trained with the Flemish painter Abraham Janssen van Nuyssen (ca. 1575–1632), who was also the teacher of Desubleo’s elder half-brother, Nicolas Régnier (1591–1667). Régnier is thought to have arrived in Rome by 1620 and it was presumably then or shortly thereafter that Desubleo joined him in the rich artistic culture in the wake of Caravaggio (1571–1610) exemplified by several artists in Régnier’s circle, notably Bartolomeo Manfredi (1582–1622). By the early 1630s, Desubleo had settled in Bologna, where he entered the workshop of Guido Reni (1575–1642) and quickly established himself among the “first painters of Bologna,” in the estimation of the biographer Carlo Cesare Malvasia (1616–1693). The distinctive classical air and colorful palette of Desubleo’s mature work are heavily indebted to Bolognese painting and to Guido Reni in particular. By 1654, Desubleo was working in the Veneto; from 1665 until his death in 1676 he was based in Parma.[1]The Painting:Executed in his final decadeAllegory of Sacred and Profane Loveis recognized as one of Desubleo’s supreme achievements, a summation of his knowledge of the artistic traditions of Rome, Bologna and Parma.[2] An adolescent allegorical figure representing Virtuous Love reclines in a landscape, bisecting the canvas diagonally between a putto representing Profane Love (who has been defeated, blindfolded, and bound to a tree) and an extensive still life (comprised of musical instruments, attributes of arts and armor, and vanitas symbols). A large lute, known as a theorbo, extends across nearly the full width of the composition, linking left and right and highlighting Profane Love’s fallen quiver. The principal figure not only wears a laurel crown in recognition of his triumph, but also holds out a second crown as if to bestow recognition of virtue upon his viewer.In taking up this subject Desubleo responded most directly to his teacher Guido Reni’s interpretation (see fig. 1 above), which would have been known to him as part of the Zambeccari collection in Bologna. The figure of Profane Love has been repeated almost verbatim, albeit in mirrored orientation; the figure of Sacred Love has sometimes been compared with Guido’sSaint John the Baptist in the Wilderness(ca. 1636; The Dulwich Picture Gallery), though this connection is more that of a generalized, adolescent type. Desubleo’s use of the figure in order to diagonally bisect a horizontal composition comes closer to examples in his own work from his decade in Parma, notably hisDavid and Goliath(mid-1670s; private collection). The generalized facial features employed by Desubleo, including the thin, straight nose and almond-shaped eyes, take their cue from classical sculpture. Very similar physiognomies are found in hisRebecca and Eliza at the Well(1650s; Palazzo Colonna, Rome) and his half-lengthDavid with the Head of Goliath(1640s; Sainta Maria di Galliera, Bologna).[3] While Desubleo’s artistic models were certainly Italian, it is worth noting that from his earliest training with Janssen in Flanders he would have begun to absorb such dramatic use of the male nude, notably in works such as Janssen’s CaravaggesqueThe Dead Christ in the Tomb with Two Angels(1971.101) in The Met’s collection.Desubleo took such care with the still-life elements that they vie for equal, if not greater, attention than do the human figures. The calculated geometry, bravura foreshortening, and complexity of a pile of string instrument in particular suggest a link to the enigmatic painter Evaristo Baschenis (1617–1677; fig. 2). Working only around one hundred miles from Parma, in Bergamo, Baschenis’s idiosyncratic still lifes were surely known to Desubleo and seem to have inspired him here; however, the proposition that the two artists actually collaborated on this canvas seems to be unsubstantiated both in terms of painterly technique and the consistent facture evident across the painting’s surface.[4] In large works such as this, Desubleo frequently employed a relatively hard external outline, almost cartoonlike in approach, so as to be legible from a distance. Perhaps this led naturally to a kind of over-articulation and interest in geometries. The compositional game of arranging the hollow wooden forms of string instruments is found in works by other artists of the period, albeit in more subtle ways, as in The Met’sAllegory of Music(50.189) by Laurent de La Hyre.In 1690, Desubleo’sAllegory of Sacred and Profane Lovewas paired with his now lostCain and Abelin the collection of Gian Simone Boscoli, a patrician figure in Parma who authored books on military architecture and mathematics. Boscoli’s scholarly interests may also explain the pronounced interest in geometry that sets this painting apart within Desubleo’s oeuvre. While in the Boscoli collection, Desubleo’sAllegory of Sacred and Profane LoveandCain and Abelhad white frames, as recorded in the inventory description: “Due quadri bislonghi della medesima grandezza, con cornice bianca, d’altezza br. 2 10., lung. sa br. 3. 8. – In uno sopra, un’Amore virtuoso che ha sotto i piedi l’Amore vitioso circondato da istromenti virtuosi, musicali, guerieri, ed altri, fatto di mano propria, di Michele Desobleo [sic] fiammingo, stimato doppie quindici. / Nel’altro del med.mo Fiammengo, vi è Caino che uccide Abele, stimato doppie quindici.”[5] A reminder of the intersection of the arts and learning that encompassed painting, mathematics, music, and literature in Baroque Europe as found in Desubleo’s canvas, in 1686 Benedetto Bacchini described Boscoli’s palazzo as “a learned and rich museum.”[6]David Pullins 2021[1] On Desubleo’s life and work, see Cottino 2001.[2] “capolavoro: non solo di Desubleo, ma di tutto il Seicento classicita italiano.” Cottino 2001, p. 125.[3] Cottino 2001, nos. 17, 37.[4] Cirillo and Godi 1995, pp. 25–28.

        "Intro Description": "This painting is one of the supreme achievements of Michele Desubleo, a Flemish artist who trained in Rome alongside his stepbrother, Nicolas Régnier, before joining the workshop of Guido Reni. Desubleo combines Reni’s sensual depiction of the human form, citing hisSacred and Profane Love(Palazzo Spinola, Genoa), with a magnificent still life comprised of musical instruments, painter’s palette, fragments of sculpture, and armor that must have satisfied his learned humanist audience who—ideally, at least—balanced material pleasures with virtuous behavior.",

However, Sir Charles Frederick, her father-in-law, seems to have been painted by the artist early in 1776 (location unknown; see T. Humphry Ward and W. Roberts,Romney: A Biographical and Critical Essay, with a Catalogue Raisonné of His Works, London, 1904, vol. 2, p. 58). If the details about the sitter come from the Frederick family, and if she is indeed Martha Rigden Frederick—both of which seem reasonable assumptions—then she most likely sat for Romney between his return from Italy in 1775 and her departure for India in 1777, dates that accord with the style of the work. Her hair and right ear, as well as the costume and background, are loosely finished, without any pretense of detail. Since Romney’s more complex and highly finished small portraits generally required five sittings, the present work may have taken no more than two or three.[2010; adapted from Baetjer 2009]",

        "Catalogue Entry": "The Artist:Cagnacci was from the town of Santarcangelo—in the Romagna region of Italy, not far from Rimini. Following his local training, he spent time in the prestigious Carracci academy in Bologna, drawing from posed models, and then went to Rome in the company of one of the great masters of Baroque painting, Guercino (he was living with Guercino in 1622). There the example of Caravaggio and the practice of painting directly from the model proved transformative. Returning to Saludecio, Rimini, Forlì, and other cities in the Romagna, he painted works of such originality that even today they can cause astonishment among those familiar with Baroque painting. His is the classic case of the provincial who, after making contact with the key figures of his day, returns home and evolves his own highly personal but at the same time highly sophisticated style. A nonconformist in life as in his art, in October 1628, Cagnacci had to flee Rimini when he attempted to elope with the widow of a prominent family. He continued to have affairs and is reported to have been accompanied in his peregrinations by a woman dressed as a man. When he moved to Venice, where he is first documented in 1649, he was, again, living with his lover/model. There he specialized in single-figure, half-length compositions for the market, often featuring a female in dishabille acting the role of Cleopatra or Lucretia. He moved from Venice to Vienna (by 1660), evidently at the invitation of Archduke Leopold I, and it was there that he painted what remains one of the most individual paintings of the entire seventeenth century:The Conversion of the Magdalen, now in the Norton Simon Museum in Pasadena. He died in Vienna.The Picture:The subject derives from Plutarch'sLivesand shows Cleopatra's suicide by an asp bite following the defeat of her beloved Mark Antony at the battle of Actium in 31 B.C. and his subsequent death. The subject was popular in the seventeenth century and was notably treated by Guido Reni (Galleria Palatina, Palazzo Pitti, Florence), whose work Cagnacci clearly knew. It is a subject that provided the kind of erotically charged as well as emotionally engaging action that appealed to the Baroque imagination, whether in poetry, theater, or painting. Shakespeare expresses the conflicted emotions found in Cagnacci’s depiction in his playAntony and Cleopatra:　\"The Stroke of death is as a lover’s pinch, / Which hurts, and is desired.\"　And a poem written by Antonio Bruni (1593–1635) on a depiction of Cleopatra by Guido Reni is equally pertinent (Le tre gratie, rime, Rome, 1630, p. 173):Ingenious brush,That giving life to Egypt’s Queen has madeHer so alive that some before her bow:Fair monarch, not by asp but love betrayed.Love kills her.The way to give her life the painter knows:The brush breathes vital spirits in her,The serpent then upon her death bestows.Like Reni’s painting, Cagnacci’s picture is an independent work suitable for the gallery of a private collector and, in fact, we know of paintings such as this one in private collections in Venice. It has been dated to about 1645–50; if it is as late as 1650, there is the possibility that it was painted for Michiel Valenzin—a Jewish resident in Venice who owned two works by Cagnacci, a Jacob and a Cleopatra (see Stefania Mason, \"Un itinerario per dipinti, disegni, stampe e qualche curiosità nelle collezioni della Venezia barocca,\" in Linda Borean and Stefania Mason,Il collezionismo d’arte a Venezia: il Seicento, Venice, 2007, p. 9). It may have been in Venice that the picture was sold to the 2nd or 3rd Earl of Caledon, in whose magnificent lodgings at 5 Carlton House Terrace, London, it is recorded in 1857, hanging in the drawing room between a painting by Guido Reni and a Madonna by Murillo.What makes this artist's work—and The Met’s picture—so notable and so essential to any history of seventeenth-century painting is the sensual realism by which Cagnacci subverts the classic compositional procedures he mastered in Bologna and Rome, primarily on the example of Guido Reni. In his work the erotic element that is always present as a sublimated feature in the Renaissance tradition of the idealized female nude in the guise of Venus, Diana, Cleopatra, etc. becomes a primary, subversive, and disorienting feature, lending his paintings a startling modernity.Cagnacci often did two variant treatments of his most successful compositions (though Salomon [2016] has posed the question of whether a workshop may have been involved in this activity). The Met’sCleopatrais related to a picture in the Collezioni Comunali d'Arte, Bologna, in which the same figure is posed against a patterned curtain, pulled back for theatrical effect. As noted in the catalogue of the exhibition on the artist held in 2008 in Forlì, in The Met’s painting, Cagnacci is less idealized and more sensual, and there is a greater emphasis on psychological engagement with the figure. The presentation is more intimate, less \"staged.\"Keith Christiansen 2016",

        "Intro Description": "Cagnacci’s erotically charged and emotionally engaging subject appealed to the Baroque imagination in poetry, theater, and painting. Taken from the ancient Greek writer Plutarch’s Lives, Cleopatra commits suicide with a viper bite following the defeat of her beloved, the Roman Mark Antony. Cagnacci’s treatment is indebted to Guido Reni, but the flagrant sensuality of her upturned eyes, flushed cheeks, and exposed breast is singular. The lethal serpent winds with unlikely elegance around her arm, the violence of its fangs hidden behind her gracefully posed hand.",

        "Catalogue Entry": "The sitter, from Westchester, New York, descended from a prominent loyalist family: her grandfather Cadwallader Colden and her uncle James De Lancey had both been loyalist lieutenant governors of New York. In 1767, in New York City, she married Ralph Izard (1741/42–1804), only surviving son and heir of Henry Izard, of The Elms, Goose Creek, a plantation near Charleston, South Carolina. Ralph had been educated from the age of twelve in England. He returned to Charleston in 1764 and lived principally at his plantation until 1771, when he and his wife settled in London. According to the inscription on the reverse of the canvas, Gainsborough painted this portrait in 1772, in Bath, a couple of years before he moved permanently to London. In 1774 and 1775 the Izards traveled on the Continent, and in 1777 the family moved to Paris for the duration of the Revolutionary War. Alice Izard remained there until 1784, when she went back to The Elms and gave birth to her fourteenth and last child. Her husband became a United States senator. After his death, she moved to Philadelphia, where she died in 1832 (see Mack 1999 for biographical information and other portraits of the Izards).Various portraits of members of Alice Izard’s family belong to The Metropolitan Museum: a canvas by Matthew Pratt (57.38) and a miniature by George Engleheart (38.146.16), both of her mother, Elizabeth, as well as a pair of portraits by John Wollaston of her grandparents Mr. and Mrs. Cadwallader Colden (22.45.6,22.45.7). In 1953 Ellis Waterhouse mentioned a portrait of Mrs. Izard by Gainsborough referred to in her husband's will of 1800 and said to have been destroyed in a fire in California. That work had descended to Mrs. Henry Fulton of New York, to whom it belonged in 1878. It seems likely to have been one of several copies, of which three others are known: an oval canvas of the same size as the present work, which once was ascribed to John Singleton Copley; a rectangular canvas with a feigned oval, also the same size, by the Charleston artist Charles Fraser; and a late nineteenth-century pastel. An engraving in which the composition was extended to show the sitter with a basket of flowers in her left hand also dates to the nineteenth century (Mack 1999).[2010; adapted from Baetjer 2009]",

        "Catalogue Entry": "The Artist:John Hoskins was the leading painter of portrait miniatures in England between the death of Nicholas Hilliard in 1619 and the rise to preeminence of his nephew and pupil Samuel Cooper (1608?–1672) in the 1640s. Hoskins began his career as a portrait painter in oils. So far only two documented paintings in this medium by him are known. They are head-and-shoulders portraits of Sir Hamon Le Strange of Hunstanton Hall, Norfolk, and his wife, Alice; her household account book records payments for them in 1617 (Prince Frederick Duleep Singh,Portraits in Norfolk Houses, Norwich, [1927], vol. 1, p. 316, no. 15 [Alice], pp. 317–18, no. 21 [Hamon]; Andrew Moore and Charlotte Crawley,Family & Friends: A Regional Survey of British Portraiture, London, 1992, pp. 84–86, nos. 18 and 19, pls. 55 and 56). It is not known who taught Hoskins the art of limning, but his earliest miniatures, seemingly from about 1615, show resemblances to those of both Nicholas Hilliard (1547–1619) and Isaac Oliver (born about 1565, died 1617). He was greatly patronized by Charles I (1600–1649) and his court; he was influenced at that time by Daniel Mytens (1590?–1648) and then by Van Dyck (1599–1641), who settled in England in 1632. The works of the 1620s and 1630s show a variety of styles, probably due to his employment of assistants, such as his nephews Alexander Cooper (1609–?1660) and Samuel Cooper and his son John Hoskins the Younger (1620/30?–after 1692). The older Hoskins died in relative poverty in 1665. John Hoskins the Younger is known to have practiced as a limner independently from 1655, but no convincing attempts to distinguish his work from his father's have yet been made.The Miniature:This miniature, or a replica, was engraved in 1810 in mezzotint as a portrait of Endymion Porter; the engraving is letteredS.Cooper pinxt. R. Earlom sct. pub. S. Woodburn 1810\"from a beautiful Miniature in the Possession of Lady Sutton.” The engraver overlooked the miniature's signature; in fact, this portrait is a fine example of Hoskins's work of about 1630.The inscription on the back of the frame records the erroneous identification of the sitter as George Villiers (1592–1628), first duke of Buckingham; the arms, however, are not his but those of a later creation of dukes of Buckingham. The correct identification of the sitter as Endymion Porter, recorded on the engraving, was reestablished by Oliver Millar (verbally, 1964, and in a letter, 1982) and is substantiated by comparison with accepted portraits of Porter, such as that by Mytens which shows him at thirty-nine in 1627 (National Portrait Gallery, London, no. 5492).Endymion Porter (1587–1649) was a protégé of the duke of Buckingham, whose niece he married, and in 1623 was employed with Buckingham in the failed negotiations for the marriage of Charles I, then Prince of Wales, to the infanta of Spain. Porter took little part in politics but remained close to the young king Charles, serving as a groom of the bedchamber. He was an important patron of literature, was greatly admired as a connoisseur, and was among the first to bring knowledge of Renaissance art to England. He also brought Anthony van Dyck to the king's notice and was instrumental in the acquisition ofRinaldo and Armida(Baltimore Museum of Art), the first Van Dyck to enter the royal collection.[2015; adapted from Reynolds and Baetjer 1996]",

Redon made over thirty depictions of the motif in oil, pastel, and pencil. In this version, he omitted any indication of a ground plane, so that the horses and charioteer appear to race across a boundless sky.",

        "Notes": "The date of 1616 is the earliest date found on any work by Jordaens. The entire figure of the shepherd was once painted over, but there is no reason to doubt the signature and date. Radiography (see Liedtke 1984, fig. 24) reveals that, initially, Jordaens included the head of an old woman to the right of the Virgin. This clarifies the relationship of our painting to similar compositions from about 1615–18. Some of these must be earlier than the Museum's picture (see Liedtke 1984).Although Michael Jaffé (1968) identifies this picture with the Adoration formerly belonging to Rubens and listed in his inventory as no. 266, that picture was on canvas and The Met's work was originally on wood, later transferred to canvas.",
        "Intro Description": "Working in Antwerp, the commercial center of the Spanish Netherlands, Jordaens catered to an international audience with Catholic devotional images such as this one, centered on the figure of the Virgin Mary. His earthy evocation of flesh influenced many artists, and his work was collected by both Vermeer and the court at The Hague. Despite his production of Catholic devotional images, Jordaens was taken after his death over the border into the Dutch Republic for a Protestant burial.",

In 1762, to escape his creditors, he left hurriedly for Dublin, where he worked until his death. Ozias Humphry (1742–1810) was his pupil and succeeded to his practice in Bath. Some confusion has arisen in the attempt to determine whether miniatures signed S.C. are by him or by Samuel Cotes (see62.122.33).This miniature is signed in the same way as the portrait of a man called Captain Bury, 1763, in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London (P.59-1927; Graham Reynolds,English Portrait Miniatures, rev. ed., Cambridge, 1988, p. 109, fig. 65).

In his youth he finished second to Richard Cosway (see62.49) in a competition held by the Society of Arts in 1755, and he has held that place ever since. Smart's miniatures bear dates from 1760, and he had an extensive clientele. He arrived in India in 1785 and worked there until 1795. He had been a director of the Society of Artists, which had continued in opposition to the Royal Academy. By the time of his return to England, the society was defunct, and Smart exhibited at the Royal Academy until his death in London in 1811. The scope of Smart's art can be studied in a remarkable collection of fifty-one miniatures, one signed and dated for each year from 1760 until 1810, which was given to the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art, Kansas City, by Mr. and Mrs. John W. Starr (John Smart—Miniaturist, exh. cat., Kansas City, 1966).This miniature is framed as a finished work of art despite the fact that the background was never colored. The frame is glazed at the back to reveal fabric, fixed to which is a recent paper label inscribedMrs Charlotte Lennox. Daphne Foskett (1964) lists a portrait of Mrs. Charlotte Lennox dated 1777; there is no evidence to show whether it is this work.[2016; adapted from Reynolds and Baetjer 1996]",

        "Notes": "This portrait was probably cut from a larger canvas.",
        "Intro Description": "When purchased by the important collector Louisine Havemeyer (1855–1929), this portrait was praised by Edgar Degas (1834–1917) and Mary Cassatt (1844–1926) as a work by Diego Velázquez (1599–1660). Its broad, frank brushwork resonates with this artist’s early paintings. By the 1930s, however, this attribution was doubted and today the painting is generally thought to be by someone in Velázquez’s circle or the workshop of the battle painter José Leonardo (1601–1652). Regardless, at some point in its history it appears to have been cut from a larger canvas in order to try to create an independent portrait.",

        "Notes": "The subject of the oval framed at the center of this composition is the origin of the name of Fontainebleau: a thirsty hunting dog named Bleau separated from its master and found in the forest a clear, pure spring; his master, \"one of our kings,\" named the spring after him \"la Fontaine de Bleau.\"This painting and one in the collection of Baron Seillière, Paris, are derived from an engraving (Robert-Dumesnil catalogue, no 18) which has been given variously to René Boyvin, Pierre Milan and, most recently, to both, jointly (see Zerner 1969). Both paintings bear the inscription that appears on the print. Rosso Fiorentino is given credit for the engraving's design, which was used for a decoration on the south wall of the central section of the Galerie François I in the Palace of Fountainebleau. Rosso died before the scheme was completed and only the decorative framework was carried out; in place of the central medallion is a painting by Francesco Primaticcio of Danae.For information about the Seillière painting, see Barbet de Jouy,Gazette des Beaux-Arts2 (1861), pp. 7–12, who mentions the engraving by Boyvin and publishes the Seillière picture, once in the collection of Cardinal Fesch, later at Château d'Anet, and in 1861 in the possession of Count de Laborde.

        "Frame": "Dutch, about 1640, ebonized fruitwood molding frame on a half-lapped back frame (see figs. 1–4 above).Put on painting in 2013.Funds for this frame were provided by Mark Fisch.",
        "Notes": "This picture may have been painted about 1609 in preparation for a major commission,The Real Presence in the Holy Sacrament(see Liedtke 1984, fig. 35) for the Dominican church of Saint Paul, Antwerp. The head on the right corresponds, in reverse, to the third saint from the left in the altarpiece. The head on the left in the Museum's picture was not used in the altarpiece, although some of the figures in the altarpiece have similar features. Three draped figures in profile, copied after Mantegna, in a drawing by Rubens of theThree Prisoners of Hercules(Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, Boston) correspond to three figures standing in a row in the right background of the altarpiece; the central figure is identical to the man on the left in the Museum's study (see Burchard 1951 and Haverkamp-Begemann 1953). Both heads in our picture apparently were employed for two figures on the right in Rubens'sAscension of Christ, an illustration for the Missale Romanum (see Judson and Velde 1978). Theodoor Galle was paid for cutting the plate for this on February 13, 1613. The head on the left in The Met's painting corresponds to a head in the center of Rubens'sRoman Triumph(National Gallery, London) of about 1630. It seems likely, however, that Rubens's source was the Gardner drawing, rather than our panel. The head on the right served as a model for the high priest inThe Woman Taken in Adultery(Musées Royaux des Beaux-Arts de Belgique, Brussels) of about 1612 (see Haverkamp-Begemann and Wolff n.d.), and the figure later became a river god in Rubens'sFour Parts of the World(Gemäldegalerie, Vienna) of about 1615 (see Goris and Held 1947). This head also resembles that of a figure at right in Rubens'sCircumcisionaltarpiece of about 1605 for the Chiesa del Gesù, Genoa; on the basis of this, Stewart (1985) suggests an earlier date for our picture.It is possible that this work is identical with the bust of Plato, one of ten \"portraits\" of famous men sold by Rubens to Balthasar I Moretus between 1612 and 1616. An engraving by Vorstermans of 1615, also called Plato, probably derives from our picture. A drawing by Vorstermans of the same composition is in the Musée du Louvre. The head on the left may be a later addition, and was painted out, probably in the seventeenth century; it was revealed in 1934.A catalogue card records a change of attribution, made by Egbert Haverkamp-Begemann in 1978, from Workshop of Rubens, about 1609, to Peter Paul Rubens.

        "Intro Description": "Rubens painted studies of heads after live models and artistic sources, creating a cast of characters that served in turn as models for figures in religious and mythological works. The main figure of this study served variously as a saint, a high priest, a river god, and the philosopher Plato. The other head, derived from one by Mantegna, had its own artistic afterlife. Rubens’s disciples Jacob Jordaens and especially Anthony van Dyck followed the same practice.",
