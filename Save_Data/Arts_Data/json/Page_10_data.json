        "Catalogue Entry": "This panel and a scene showing the Crucifixion of Christ (The Met,43.161) come from a large dismantled retable probably made for the high altar of the former Collegiate Church (Kollegiatstift) of Sankt Maria und Sankt Georg, now the Neustädter Marienkirche, in Bielefeld. One of the key monuments of late medieval painting in Westphalia, completed in 1400, the altarpiece was a triptych with folding wings about 6.56 meters wide when fully opened and about 2.18 meters high, including its lost frame. In the open state, it displayed a large central image of the Virgin and Child enthroned in the company of saints, flanked by thirty smaller scenes ranging from God Warns Adam about the Tree of Knowledge, through the life of the Virgin Mary and the Passion of Christ, to the Last Judgment, all on gold ground. The small scenes were arranged in three rows of ten, with the subjects progressing chronologically across each row, skipping over the Virgin and Child at center, from the upper left to the lower right. The folding wings displayed nine scenes each; the rest of the small scenes belonged structurally to the central panel and were thus immobile. The Museum’sFlagellationis from the far right of the middle row of the right wing. The internal divisions of the altarpiece were achieved with applied red strips decorated with rosettes at their intersections. The lost exterior decoration of the wings was probably painted either with standing saints or nonfigural ornaments.The central panel of the Bielefeld Altarpiece with its enthroned Virgin and Child and twelve New Testament scenes remains in the Marienkirche in Bielefeld. After the retable was dismantled in the course of church renovations in 1840–41, the wings were cut along their horizontal divisions, creating six three-scene fragments. It was in that state that all but one of the fragments were described (Förster 1847) and then catalogued (Krüger 1848) in the collection of Carl Wilhelm August Krüger of Minden, who probably acquired them from the church about 1840. Subsequently, the wing fragments were further divided into the individual scenes now found at the Gemäldegalerie, Berlin; the Oetker Collection and Marienkirche in Bielefeld; The Metropolitan Museum, New York; and the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford.The crown depicted in theFlagellationis unusual for the subject because it is chronologically out of place. The Gospels situate the Flagellation before the Crowning with Thorns, with both events preceded by Christ’s appearance before Pontius Pilate (Matthew 27:1–29; Mark 15:1–17; John 18:29–40, 19:1–2). The Bielefeld Altarpiece, however, displayed the opposite order, with the Crowning with Thorns leading to the Flagellation followed by Christ before Pilate. In light of what must be assumed was an intimate familiarity with the events of Christ’s Passion on the part of artist and patron, this unconventional sequence seems unlikely to have been a mistake. Pfeiffer (2009) explained the anomaly as one of several attempts to establish meaningful vertical relations among scenes, wherebyThe Flagellationappeared directly beneathThe Nativityand above theLast Judgmentto align Christ’s being born human, taking on bodily suffering, and delivering judgment upon humanity.Concerning attribution, it has long been recognized that the Bielefeld Altarpiece is by the Master of the Berswordt Altarpiece, named after a retable of the Crucifixion now in the Marienkirche, Dortmund, which bears the coat of arms of the Berswordt family of that city. With a project as extensive as the Bielefeld Altarpiece, the involvement of assistants in most stages can be taken for granted. The current compromised condition of many of the altarpiece’s parts, including The MetFlagellation, for example, which has sustained much damage in the past, necessarily frustrates any effort, as attempted in some of the literature, to distinguish between the master’s contributions and those of the workshop, assuming that such distinctions were discernible at all in the original state.Documents of the commission are not known to have survived. The patronage of the church’s college of canons has been put forth as a possibility, with the canon Hermann Crusing (who died shortly after 1397) possibly being influential in the process. Thus far, however, Pfeiffer (2009) has made the most convincing case for patronage in the persons of Wilhelm of Jülich, Duke of Berg (ca. 1348–1408), and his wife Anna of Bavaria (1346–1415), to whose territory Bielefeld belonged as part of the county of Ravensberg, and whose ancestors founded the Marienkirche and were entombed in its choir.With its secure date of 1400, the Bielefeld Altarpiece has played a pivotal role in the recent reevaluation of the Master of the Berswordt Altarpiece. The consensus view at present dates the rest of the master’s oeuvre before 1400—including the Berswordt Altarpiece in Dortmund, for which a date of 1431 has been maintained at times—thus overturning the old notion of the anonymous master as artistically dependent on Conrad von Soest, the greatly important Westphalian painter whose earliest surviving work dates from 1403. This reconsideration increasingly posits the Master of the Berswordt Altarpiece as a significant figure in the reception of artistic ideas emerging from France and the southern Netherlands and in the stylistic development of art in Westphalia and nearby Cologne.[2014; adapted from Waterman in Ainsworth and Waterman 2013]",
        "Technical Notes": "Before this work entered the Museum’s collection, the paint layers, ground, and fabric of were transferred from the original wooden support to a secondary fabric support and then adhered to a plywood panel with a wax adhesive. No evidence of the original support remains.Dendrochronological analysis of wood from other parts of the altarpiece to which this work andThe Crucifixion(The Met 43.161) belonged, including the central panel and panels from the left and right wings, indicated an earliest possible fabrication date of 1373 for the whole emsemble.Fabric was glued to the panel supports of bothThe FlagellationandThe Crucifixionand before the white ground preparation was applied. There is no apparent priming layer. In both paintings the ground was incised to indicate the areas to be gilded, and the gilding that forms the backgrounds was applied directly to the ground. Ground gilding (calledLeimvergoldungin German) has been documented in North European paintings that date, for the most part, from the thirteenth century. The smoothed ground layer is coated with an aqueous adhesive such as animal glue, to which the gold leaf is applied and then burnished and tooled, as desired.The artist relied on a layering technique—with particular emphasis on scumbles—to achieve color effects and to create volume. The blended brushstrokes and creamy appearance of the paint suggest that the medium could be a \"fatty\" tempera, in which oil is mixed with an egg-yolk binder. The use of this medium has been reported in studies of other paintings from the same altarpiece.Overall the paintings are in fair condition; however, the surfaces are worn along the edges of an extensive crack pattern, and abrasion from harsh cleaning has increased the visibility of the original underlying fabric. The brown painted borders on both panels are not original. Examination with the stereomicroscope reveals fragments of an opaque red below the brown overpaint; this may perhaps be fragmentary evidence of the red and white patterned border present on other panels of the altarpiece. Numerous paint losses inThe Flagellationoccurred when the painting was transferred to new supports.When the surfaces of both paintings are examined in normal light, some underdrawing in the form of cursory contours applied with a liquid medium is visible. Examination with infrared reflectography did not reveal any further underdrawing, although investigations of other panels attributed to the same artist have found underdrawing executed with brush, red chalk, and possibly metalpoint.[2013; adapted from German Paintings catalogue]",

        "Notes": "The Flagellation and the Crucifixion (43.161) were among eighteen scenes that made up the interior wings of an altarpiece that was intact in the Neustädter Marienkirche, Bielefeld, until the church was restored about 1840. According to nineteenth-century sources, the original frame bore the date of 1400. The central panel, a Glorification of the Virgin flanked by twelve scenes, is still in the Bielefeld church. The eighteen scenes from the wings along with the twelve scenes of the main panel formed a sequence of the fall of man and the life of the Virgin and of Christ, concluding with the Last Judgment. They were arranged in three registers reading across the width of the open altarpiece from left to right, the altarpiece measuring altogether about 182 x 550 cm. The individual scenes were originally separated by stucco borders which were removed in restoration. The subject of the exterior wings is not known.Of the other scenes from the wings, God Warning Adam and Eve, Adoration of the Magi, Flight into Egypt, and Betryal of Christ are in the R. A. Oetker Museum, Bielefeld; the Presentation in the Temple is in the Gemäldegalerie, Berlin; Christ before Pilate is in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford; and Carrying of the Cross is in a private collection, London.Tracings of all but three of the scenes from the wings are preserved at the Westfälisches Denkmalamt, Münster.The Master of the Berswordt Altar is named after the altarpiece with scenes of the Passion in the Marienkirche, Dortmund, which bears the arms of the von Berswordt family on the frame.",
        "Intro Description": "These panels were among thirty scenes of an extensive narrative cycle that formed part of a large altarpiece from the Neustädter Marienkirche in Bielefeld, Westphalia. They were created two decades before panel painting underwent a revolution through the art of Jan van Eyck, Robert Campin, and Rogier van der Weyden, who achieved a new sense of realism in their works. The artist, one of the foremost painters of the International Gothic style in northwest Germany, still adhered to the traditional gilded background, although the inclusion of a horizon and some schematic natural motifs indicate an outdoor setting for both scenes.",

        "Catalogue Entry": "This painting, which unfortunately has suffered considerably, is certainly by Jacob Pynas and may be dated to the late 1620s, partly on the basis of comparison with the artist's different rendering of the subject, dated 1628 (Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam). At some late date, the monogram PL was painted on top of Pynas's own, in order to pass the picture off as a work by the more important Amsterdam artist who strongly influenced Pynas, Pieter Lastman (1583–1633).The subject is taken from Acts 14:6–18. Paul and Barnabas, having been driven out of Iconium by both the Gentiles and the Jews, flee to Lystra, in Lycaonia (Asia Minor), where they preach the Gospel. When Paul heals a cripple by commanding him to walk, the locals \"[lift] up their voices,\" declaring that Jupiter and Mercury \"are come down to us in the likeness of men.\" A statue of Jupiter stands before the city (Pynas shows the statue to the upper right), and the high priest of the temple has the people bring garlands and sacrificial oxen (in the painting, the procession, with two garlanded oxen, approaches from the left background). In frustration, the apostles tear at their clothes, crying, \"We are also men of like passions with you, and preach unto you that ye should turn from these vanities unto the living God\" (who, as Paul, pointing upward, indicates in the painting, is in heaven, not present as a graven image). Pynas depicts the priest in a white robe and surrounded by excited celebrants, some with torches and one with a tambourine. Behind him, the bearded man with bare feet must be the former cripple; a worshipful woman lifts his tunic and gestures at his healed legs. On the steps, Barnabas twists around and rends his garment, attracting curious spectators.Lastman had treated the subject at least twice in the previous decade, in a painting of 1614 (location unknown) and in a canvas dated 1617 (Amsterdams Historisch Museum). Except for the gesturing Paul in the earlier picture, the later work is closer to the Pynas, both in composition and in the placement of key figures such as the apostles and the priest. The idea of adding a rooster to the sacrifice may also come from Lastman's panel of 1617. Pynas's picture of 1628 presents the action more clearly, in a less crowded arrangement, than does the New York painting or either work by Lastman. This might be taken to suggest that The Met’s picture was painted slightly earlier than the version in Amsterdam, but other evidence may now be lost, and a survey of known works by Pynas does not suggest a linear development.[2016; adapted from Liedtke 2007]",

        "Catalogue Entry": "Aside from the damage to the Virgin’s face and the discoloration of her blue mantle and the green of the garden, this work is in exceptionally fine condition and retains its original, engaged frame, decorated with a floral motif and the artist’s signature and date, 1420. It is one of the most refined works by Pietro di Domenico, who was a leading, late Gothic painter active in the Marches. The Virgin is shown seated on a cloth spread in a garden, surrounded by music-making angels. Other angels, tooled into the gold background rather than painted, hold a crown over her. Seraphs decorate her mantle. Thus a number of themes traditionally associated with the Madonna are combined: Mary as Queen of Heaven; the Madonna of Humility, the Madonna in ahortus conclusus, or enclosed garden (the lack of an enclosure is not unusual in Italian painting of the period). The Christ Child is shown asleep on her lap, covered with a transparent veil, a motif frequently thought to refer Christ to the Eucharist and its presentation with a humeral veil. He wears a coral amulet as a talisman. The picture thus has some of the same imagery found in such popular sources as the medieval hymn, the Salve Regina.De Marchi (1987) rightly suggests that the technique of incising the angels into the gold background derives from Gentile da Fabriano. It is a practice otherwise more common to goldsmith work of the period than to painting.The first record (in 1841) of The Met'spicture is in a convent near Naples and this has given rise to suggestions about contacts between the Marches and the Kingdom of Naples and of the range of Pietro’s activity (Bologna 1985). However, Mazzalupi (2006) has suggested that the picture could well have been moved from a Camaldolese hermitage near Ancona—the area in which we know Pietro di Domenico to have been active. It is the kind of deluxe object that was intended for private devotion in a domestic setting.Keith Christiansen 2011",

Among the layers of surface details are two remarkable angels freely tooled into the gold background as they crown the Madonna queen of heaven. The Christ Child is shown in a deep sleep—an allusion to his future sacrifice and death. It is one of the finest works by Pietro di Domenico, who was active in the region of the Marches. Exceptionally, the picture survives intact with its original engaged frame decorated with a continuous flower pattern and the artist’s signature.",

        "Catalogue Entry": "The Guardis were a family of painters from the foothills of the Alps to the north who were active in Venice throughout the eighteenth century. Francesco Guardi’s father died in 1716, when he was a small boy, and his brother, Giovanni Antonio or Gianantonio Guardi (1699–1760), a figure painter and copyist, took over the family studio. Francesco worked there for decades. Only when he was in his forties, after Canaletto returned to Venice from England but before Gianantonio’s death, did he decide to become a view painter. He rarely dated his work, which was little mentioned by his contemporaries, and it has been difficult to establish a chronology, but the present painting and its companions (53.225.3,53.225.4) may be from no earlier than the middle of the 1760s.In 1953, the Museum received as the gift of Julia A. Berwind a pair of shaped canvases by Francesco Guardi, imaginary views (capricci) of the lagoon with antique ruins and mountains. Previously, the pictures had belonged to Miss Berwind’s brother Edgar, and were photographed in the drawing room of The Elms, his mansion in Newport, Rhode Island. Here they joined this even larger view (it is nearly nine feet wide), purchased in 1941, with which they form a set. All three had been brought to New York in 1912 by the dealers Gimpel & Wildenstein and came from the Castello di Colloredo di Monte Albano, north of Udine in the Friuli, where the Colloredo Mels family had lived for centuries and where the capricci were first recorded in 1894 (see fig. 1 above).The imaginary landscapes seem to have been enlarged to their present arched shape; each of the pair of smaller paintings also has a wide strip added to the bottom edge. The changes are thought to have been made while Guardi was working on them or shortly thereafter. They were installed in plaster surrounds, each in the middle of a wall, in an eighteenth-century drawing room on the piano nobile of the castle of Colloredo, a medieval structure with later additions damaged in the 1976 earthquake and now much rebuilt. Photographs taken in situ, before the capricci were sold, reveal that they were not an integral part of the decorative scheme of the room from which they came. No documentation was ever found at Colloredo di Monte Albano, reports of a receipt acknowledging payment to the artist of three hundred gold pieces notwithstanding, and therefore it is not certain, though possible, that they were painted for the Colloredo family. The scale, broad handling, and shaped contours of the paintings suggest that they were designed as overdoors, in which case they necessarily would have been commissioned.Katharine Baetjer 2011",

        "Intro Description": "This imaginary landscape, or capriccio, is one of three in The Met’s collection from the castle of Colloredo di Monte Albano, near Udine. Their sizes and shapes seem to have been adjusted by Guardi in the course of painting or immediately thereafter, probably in order to be fit into decorative plaster surrounds. Guardi built these picturesque compositions from rocky outcroppings, slanting tree trunks, and classical ruins, which are populated by fishermen and their families.",

        "Notes": "This is one of the first three still lifes ever exhibited by Cézanne (see Paris 1877). Certain elements are familiar as recurring props, such as the wooden table, painted sugar bowl, and 6-panel, double-sided screen. The sugar bowl and screen appear together in FWN 813 (Musée d'Orsay, Paris); the sugar bowl alone in FWN 706 (Musée Granet, Aix-en-Provence), FWN 807 (Bayerische Staatsgemäldesammlungen, Munich), FWN 808 (Fogg Museum, Harvard Art Museums, Cambridge), FWN 837 (Musée de l'Orangerie, Paris), FWN 855 (J. Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles), FWN 883 (Museum of Modern Art, New York), FWN 1969 (Osterreichische Galerie Belvedere, Vienna), and FWN 1973 (The Met2001.202.1); and the screen alone in FWN 521 (National Gallery, Prague), FWN 524 (Kimbell Art Museum, Fort Worth), FWN 838, 863, and 865 (Barnes Foundation, Philadelphia), and FWN 864 (private collection).Scholars had long thought the screen was painted by Cézanne for his father, with the assistance of his childhood friend Emile Zola, in about 1859–60, making it the artist’s earliest recorded painting (FWN 560). Emile Bernard, however, described it as painted by a “skillful, almost Italian” hand and reported that, at the end of his life, Cézanne said only that he had “often played in this screen with Zola” and that the two \"even spoiled some [of its] flowers” (Emile Bernard, “Souvenirs sur Paul Cézanne et lettres inédites,”Mercure de France[October 1, 1907], p. 391; reprinted in Bernard 1925). Following this early source, and based on stylistic evidence, Theodore Reff questioned the attribution of the entire screen to Cézanne, especially its back. Rather, he suggested the screen was a preexisting object of local Provençal manufacture, which the young Cézanne altered only by adding figures to its front. (See Reff, \"Cézanne's Early Paravent at the Jas de Bouffan,\"Jas de Bouffan—Cézanne[Aix-en-Provence, 2004], pp. 56–67.) Although Reff dismissed Zola’s participation in these alterations, Philippe Cézanne suggested that Zola could have contributed to it before his departure for Paris at the beginning of 1858 or during summer holidays spent in Provence (see Cézanne 2019).In this picture, the screen has been folded to show both its front—painted with a landscape and figures inside a wide floral border, of which only a sliver is visible on the far right—and its back— decorated with arabesques, flowers, and grotesque motifs. After the screen began to appear in Cézanne's work in the late 1870s, the artist kept it with him as he moved from studio to studio until the end of his life. The two sides have since been separated, flattened, and mounted on new stretchers (front: private collection; back: Musée Granet, Aix-en-Provence).",

        "Catalogue Entry": "The Artist:Bernardo Daddi was one of the most important painters of the early Trecento in Florence. He began his activity there in the 1320s during the height of Giotto’s reign over Florentine painting. While his works reveal the influence of Giotto’s recent stylistic innovations, Daddi distinguished himself from his contemporaries with lavish and richly decorated works reminiscent of those of the Sienese painters, such as Pietro and Ambrogio Lorenzetti. It was this quality of Daddi’s paintings that led the art historian and connoisseur Bernard Berenson to describe him as \"the most Sienese of all Florentines that ever painted.\" Daddi enjoyed success early in his career as a painter of small-scale, devotional works. By the 1330s, he must have maintained a sizeable workshop to meet the demand for smaller panels and altarpieces, best exemplified by his triptych of 1333 in the Bigallo in Florence. Daddi also executed several major works during his mature period. Following the death of Giotto in 1337, Daddi became the most active painter in Florence, receiving commissions for some of the largest and most important works of the 1330s and 1340s, including the largeMadonna and Child with Angels(1346–47) for Orsanmichele and the so-called San Pancrazio altarpiece (1337–44), which went on to influence altarpiece painting for the remainder of the fourteenth century in Florence.The Subject:The Met owns three panels relating to the life of the third-century Christian martyr, one of the patron saints of Florence and the ex-titular of the Florentine cathedral prior to its rebuilding in Gothic style (begun in 1296 and rededicated to the Virgin Mary as Santa Maria del Fiore). This panel depicts the first scene of the martyrdom of Saint Reparata. According to theActa Sanctorum, Reparata was a young girl from Caesarea in Palestine and was martyred during the Roman Emperor Decius’s persecution of the Christians. She was brought before Decius and refused to sacrifice to the Roman pantheon, instead offering to burn herself as a sacrifice to Christ. Decius subjected her to a number of torments for her defiance, all of which she miraculously survived before being beheaded. Here she has her initial encounter with the emperor, who interrogates the young girl. The scene is enclosed within a delicate architectural structure and set against a highly decorated textile. Daddi condenses action and reaction into a single moment: Decius extends his arm as he condemns the girl, a gesture that is then answered by Reparata, who clutches her robe and touches her hand to her chest as she receives the emperor’s pronouncement. Daddi often employed this constellation of figures in his depictions of a saint’s martyrdom. Several of his predella panels and two frescoed scenes include a persecutor pointing at a martyr, who in turn responds with a subtle and expressive gesture. However, in no other example of this figural arrangement in Daddi’s oeuvre does the martyr’s reaction compare with the elegance and charm of Reparata’s response to Decius.The Predella:Steinweg (1956) correctly identified the subject of the picture and further associated it with five other panels as the base, or predella, from what, she conjectured, was a highly important altarpiece for the old cathedral of Santa Reparata. The identification of the main panels and the reconstruction of its component parts took place in stages: Conti (1968) identified the main panels as those from an unusually large complex in the Uffizi that includes in one of its lateral panels an image of Saint Reparata. This seven-part altarpiece (polyptych) was known to come from the church of San Pancrazio, where it was mentioned by Vasari (1568), who, however, erroneously ascribed it Agnolo Gaddi. From its documented presence in San Pancrazio, the altarpiece is usually referred to as the San Pancrazio Altarpiece. However, as Padoa Rizzo (1993) and Spilner (1997) independently proposed, the original destination of this altarpiece was the old cathedral, of which Saint Reparata was the titular saint. This is now firmly established (see Bergstein 1991 and Lavin 1999).The Altarpiece:The San Pancrazio (or, rather, the Saint Reparata) Altarpiece was an exceptionally elaborate altarpiece, consisting of seven main panels, pinnacles, and a two-tiered predella depicting in the upper register, in eight panels, the life of the Virgin, and in the lower register, the story of the martyrdom of Saint Reparata (see fig. 1 above). The details surrounding the commission and execution of the altarpiece were long uncertain. Vasari’s suggestion in theLives of the Artiststhat the polyptych was made for the high altar of the church of San Pancrazio in Florence was commonly accepted and repeated throughout the critical literature. However, it is now established that the polyptych was commissioned for the high altar of the Florentine cathedral and was completed between 1337 and 1344. At the time, the new cathedral complex, with—as noted above—a dedication to Santa Maria del Fiore rather than Santa Reparata, was still under construction and so the altarpiece was placed on a provisional altar in the nave of the old cathedral, which was pulled down by 1375 to make way for the enlarged, Gothic structure we see today. The altarpiece was sold and transferred to the church of San Pancrazio, where in the mid-eighteenth century it was dismantled (see Poggi 1988 and Casu 2014). While the majority of the individual panels were placed in the Uffizi in the early nineteenth century (fig. 2), fifteen of the roughly fifty original panels of the polyptych (including the predella with scenes of Saint Reparata) had already been lost, sold, destroyed, or forgotten.The Saint Reparata Predella:Six panels from the Saint Reparata series forming, as we now know, the lower register of the predella, are known today and, following their narrative sequence, are as follows:Saint Reparata before the Emperor Decius,Saint Reparata in Prison(private collection; fig. 3),Saint Reparata Tortured with Red-Hot Irons(The Met,41.190.15),Martyrdom of Saint Reparata in an Oven(Wallraf-Richartz-Museum, Cologne, no. 878),Saint Reparata Being Prepared for Execution(The Met,43.98.4), andBeheading of Saint Reparata(Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister, Dresden, Gal.-Nr. 3577). Until recently, scholars only knew theBeheading of Saint Reparatathrough two photographs, likely taken in the early twentieth century. Hipp (2010) first published the panel after it was identified in the Gemäldegalerie, Dresden, having arrived in Dresden in the 1940s among many works of art purchased or confiscated by the Nazis during World War II. It should be noted that although the six known panels were at first thought to constitute the complete series, Preiser (1973) and Boskovits (1989) opined that the predella was originally made up of eight panels, the two additional ones yet to be found. Given that the upper-register predella had eight scenes and that Vasari mentions a predella with eight stories of the Madonna and of Saint Reparata [\"otto storie della Madonna e di Santa Reparata\"], this must be correct. Boskovits cited iconographical reasons for a reconstruction with eight panels, suggesting that two additional scenes of the martyrdom described in theActa Sanctorummight have been the subjects of the missing panels. However, the reconstruction of the predella offered by Boskovits is flawed on two counts: the position of theSaint Reparata Tortured with Red-Hot Ironsand the potential subject of the sixth (missing) panel. A revised reconstruction of the eight-panel predella is proposed based on visual evidence and the hagiographic account of the martyrdom.Although Boskovits maintained that theSaint Reparata Tortured with Red-Hot Ironswas the third panel of the predella, it was most likely the fourth in the series. In the first reconstruction of the Saint Reparata panels, Steinweg suggested that theSaint Reparata Tortured with Red-Hot Ironsand theMartyrdom of Saint Reparata in an Ovenwere the central panels of the predella (positioned in the lower tier beneath the main panel with the Madonna and Child), as they are the only two works in which the saint is presented frontally. This claim was overlooked by Boskovits, who, without explanation, shifted the panel away from the center of predella, assigning it the third position in his reconstruction. Nevertheless, the legend of Saint Reparata’s martyrdom seems to confirm that these two works were in fact the central panels of the predella (i.e., the fourth and fifth panels, respectively). TheActa Sanctorumrelates that the first trial undergone by the saint, before being tortured with hot irons, was having boiling lead poured on her. This is one of the two major scenes from the legend that is not among the known panels of Daddi’s predella. Although Boskovits recognized that one of the missing panels must have portrayed Reparata being tortured with boiling lead, he assumed that this scene occupied the fourth position in the series, whereas according to the narrative sequence of the legend, it should instead be the third andSaint Reparata Tortured with Red-Hot Ironsthe fourth.In addition to incorrectly ordering panels, Boskovits erroneously suggested that the sixth panel of the predella (the second missing work) depicted the beheading of Saint Reparata, a scene that is already among the known panels of the series. The only other major scene of the legend that is omitted from current reconstructions of the predella is Saint Reparata being stabbed with swords, an event that directly precedes the preparation of Saint Reparata for her execution. Although there is no precedent for a depiction of this scene, in a series of this complexity, devoted to a patron saint, it seems likely that Daddi depicted it. The panel would have occupied the sixth place in the sequence, the seventh showing the saint being prepared for martyrdom. Accordingly, the most up-to-date reconstruction of the predella would be as follows:Saint Reparata before the Emperor Decius(Scene I),Saint Reparata in Prison(Scene II); Missing, possiblySaint Reparata Tortured with Boiling Lead(Scene III),Saint Reparata Tortured with Red-Hot Irons(Scene IV),Martyrdom of Saint Reparata in an Oven(Scene V), Missing, possiblySaint Reparata Pierced with Swords(Scene VI),Saint Reparata Being Prepared for Execution(Scene VII), andBeheading of Saint Reparata(Scene VIII).Conclusion:The San Pancrazio altarpiece represents the apex of Bernardo Daddi’s achievement and testifies to the artist’s unrivalled ability to produce cohesive compositions on a small scale. The altarpiece also stands as a testament to his lasting influence on Florentine painting. Daddi transformed the predella from a series of discrete scenes into a continuous narrative sequence, an innovation that greatly influenced the next several generations of Florentine painters. His other major innovation was the pairing of the life of the Virgin with the martyrdom of Saint Reparata in a double predella. The impact of this innovation is demonstrated by the fact that less than twenty years after the completion of the altarpiece, Giovanni da Milano was commissioned to include a double predella in his polyptych for the high altar of the church of Ognissanti in Florence. Paradoxically, it was this innovation by Daddi that long prevented scholars from associating the Saint Reparata predella with the San Pancrazio altarpiece.The question of when the Saint Reparata predella panels were separated from the larger polyptych remains uncertain. None of the known documents relating to Daddi’s altarpiece, including the account of its disassembly, record the fate of these panels. And while scholars have tentatively linked the dispersal of the predella to the earliest known owners of panels from the predella, the English collectors and dealers William Young Ottley (who is known, for example, to have acquired parts of an altarpiece for Santa Croce by Ugolino da Siena) and George Augustus Wallis, it is unclear when or from whom the works were purchased. By the time theSaint Reparata before the Emperor Deciusentered The Met’s collection, it was in a poor state of conservation. The panel was already described in the catalogue for the 1937Mostra Giottescain Florence as having a large horizontal crack and as having been \"danneggiatissime da sgraffiature\" (severely damaged with scratches). In spite of the damage and the subsequent restoration of the panel, it nonetheless clearly demonstrates Daddi’s enormous skill and exquisite handling. The brilliant colors, the intricate details of the hangings, and the dynamic choreography of the figures combine to produce a prime example of the masterful small-scale paintings for which Daddi is best known.[Dominic Ferrante 2016]",

        "Intro Description": "Martyred under the third-century Roman emperor Decius, Saint Reparata was a patron saint of Florence, for whom its cathedral was named. These panels are from the high altarpiece of that city’s cathedral (the main panels are now in the Uffizi Gallery, Florence). Unusually, the altarpiece had a double, or two-tiered, base (predella), the lower level of which showed eight scenes from the saint’s life. Her tormentors have been scratched out and defaced by viewers who responded in outrage to their actions.",

        "Intro Description": "Monet spent the spring of 1889 painting the landscape around the confluence of two rivers, the Petite Creuse and the Grande Creuse, at the village of Fresselines in central France. For this view, which is nearly identical to another picture (private collection), he positioned his easel on the steep bank of the ravine edging the Petite Creuse, looking down on the shallow rapids from above. The resulting composition omits the sky and other indicators of depth, creating an ambiguous space that produces a strongly two-dimensional effect. Monet included numerous Creuse scenes among his 145 submissions to a blockbuster joint exhibition with sculptor Auguste Rodin in the summer of 1889 at Galerie Georges Petit in Paris.",

The sitter in this miniature wears the Garter ribbon. Among the persons invested with that order in the early years of the eighteenth century was George Augustus, the son of George Louis (later elector of Hanover and George I of Great Britain and Ireland) by his wife Sophia Dorothea of Celle. The future George II received the Garter in 1706. Although this is somewhat earlier in date than the standard Kneller portrait of 1716 (Oliver Millar,The Tudor, Stuart and Early Georgian Pictures in the Collection of Her Majesty the Queen, London, 1963, no. 34-3, pl. 14-7), the comparison suggests that he may be portrayed here.

        "Catalogue Entry": "This altarpiece depicts Saint Roch (ca. 1348–1376/79), known as a plague saint for his miracles in curing the sick. He became a popular figure in art following the Black Death in the fourteenth century and the Italian plague outbreak of 1477–79. He is often shown displaying a bubo on his upper thigh as he appeals to God to provide protection from disease. Votive paintings such as this were intended to supply hope and act as safeguards against future outbreaks.The subject matter of this painting reflects the mission of the church and hospital where this altarpiece originally hung in Bologna, Santa Maria della Morte (Holy Mary of Death). The hospital, established in 1347 to care for jailed and condemned people, soon expanded its mission to include caring for the sick as the Black Death began spreading across Europe that same year.[1]Contrary to the grim nature of its subject matter, Francia’s Saint Roch is a sweetly reassuring figure. Locked in an otherworldly exchange with God, he faintly gestures towards his afflicted thigh as he gazes upward to receive God’s blessing. Set within the serenely rolling hills of the countryside, the verdant landscape and light-filled blue sky are themselves representations of reprieve in their focus on clear air and unconfined space. The painting showcases the influence of Umbrian painter Perugino (ca. 1446/1452–1523), whose Scarani Altarpiece in the neighboring church of San Giovanni in Monte in Bologna would have been studied closely by Francia. This is particularly evident in the similarities between Perugino’s figure of the Archangel Michael and Francia’s Saint Roch.[2]The painting is signed and dated on acartellino—the illusionistic paper at the bottom left—\"FRACIA AVRIFBER/ MCCCCCII.\" The signature suggests Francia’s interest in emphasizing that he was a skilled practitioner of several arts, signing it, as he often did, with the Latin word for goldsmith (aurifaberor in other casesaurifex). In addition to his fame as a painter, Francia was a renowned goldsmith, medalist (see for example his Portrait medal of Cardinal Francesco degli Alidosi with Jupiter and signs of the zodiac in The Met’s collection (1975.1.1274), and a master of the highly specialized niello medium, a technique of inlaying a black enamel-like compound into engraved and etched metal. He was made director of the Bolognese Mint in 1508 and would remain in charge of executing the city’s coinage until his death in 1517. Writing in 1550, historian Leandro Alberti (1479–1552) commented that Francia would refer to himself as a goldsmith when signing paintings, and a painter when signing works in metal. Though there are no known examples of Francia’s signed metalworks to confirm this, Alberti’s comment speaks to the ways in which artists used their signature to advertise their varied skills.Tiffany Racco 2023[1] D'Apuzzo 2015[2] Negro and Roio 1998[3] Leandro Alberti,Descrittione di tutta Italia, Bologna, 1550, p. 300",

        "Intro Description": "This altarpiece by Francesco Francia, the leading artist in Bologna, was painted in 1502 for the church and hospital of Santa Maria della Morte (Holy Mary of Death). It depicts Saint Roch, who died in 1376 or 1377 after being unjustly imprisoned in Montpellier. The bubo on Saint Roch’s thigh shows that he is a plague saint whose powers lie in curing the sick. His mission as both a healer and a patron saint of the falsely accused reflects the hospital’s commitment to caring for prisoners and victims of the Black Death. On the feast day of Saint Roch, members of Santa Maria della Morte honored his memory by releasing a prisoner.",

        "Catalogue Entry": "As first argued by Wehle (1940) and as demonstrated by the coats of arms that appear in the various scenes, this unusually richly decorated front of a marriage chest, or cassone, shows three episodes chronicling the conquest of Naples by Charles III of Durazzo (1345/57–1386) in 1381. Other proposed identifications—the taking of Salerno (Perkins 1907), the capture of the Castel Nuovo in Naples by René of Anjou in 1441 (Mather 1912), the siege of Taranto (Bologna 1969 and Boskovits 1991)—cannot be sustained (Fahy 1994).Charles III of Durazzo was the sole male descendant of the house of Durazzo, an offshoot of the Hungarian branch of the Angevin dynasty. Born between 1345 and 1357, he was raised at the court of Naples but received his education at Buda in Hungary, where he was invested by his second cousin Louis the Great, king of Hungary, with Dalmatia and Croatia. In 1370 he married his cousin Margherita of Durazzo, daughter and heiress of the prince of Durazzo; Margherita’s mother, Mary of Anjou, was the younger sister of Joan I, queen of Naples, which provided Charles with his claim to the throne. Initially, Joan recognized Charles as her heir, but in 1380 she instead adopted a brother of the king of France, Louis I of Anjou. Louis the Great thereupon ordered Charles to depose Joan. Making his way southward and gaining the support of Pope Urban VI, in June 1381 Charles was invested with the kingdoms of Sicily and Jerusalem and crowned King of Naples and Gonfalonier (standard bearer) of the Church. There followed a skirmish with Otto of Brunswick, Joan’s fourth and last husband, near Anagni; the victorious Charles entered Naples on June 28. Otto was exiled and in 1382 (but later returned); Joan was strangled in prison. When Louis the Great died that same year, Charles claimed the Hungarian crown and returned to Buda, where in 1386 he was assassinated by Louis’s widow.In the right hand scene of the cassone, Charles, shown with a crown on his blond hair and wearing an elaborate tunic, wages war at Anagni against Otto of Brunswick. In the center scene Otto, shown with a moustache and goatee and wearing an orange tunic, submits to Charles, who is mounted on a white steed. In the left hand scene Charles enters the gates of Naples as victor, accompanied by his captive, the pigtailed Otto. Naples is recognizable, though schematically rendered—perhaps the earliest recognizable depiction of the city (Leone de Castris 2011). Crowning the hill is the castle of Belforte with, below it, the Certosa. The Castel dell’Ovo is on the island on the extreme left while the Castelnuovo and the cathedral are also prominently shown. The artist was clearly well informed about the topography of the city but did not have first-hand knowledge of the appearance of the buildings.The troops of Charles are clearly identified by the three standards: the arms of the kings of Hungary (horizontal red and silver bars) impaled with the arms of the Angevin house (gold fleurs-de-lis on blue); the Gonfalonier of the Church (the crossed keys of Saint Peter on red); and the arms of Durazzo (gold fleurs-de-lis on blue, a red label with two points, and a red and white border) and those of Jerusalem (a large gold cross having crossbars at the ends and four smaller crosses on white). The arms of Durazzo and Jerusalem also appear in the roundels between the scenes. Otto of Brunswick is identified by his standard of two gold lions on a red field. Fahy (1994) has given the most detailed reading of the three scenes as well as a cogent refutation of the alternative identification of the king as Ladislaus (1377–1414), Charles’ son and heir. Ladislaus could, however, have commissioned the cassone celebrating his father’s victory, either when he reconquered the city in 1399 or upon his marriage to Maria of Lusignan in 1401—she arrived in Naples in 1402 (Leone de Castris 2011). Alternatively, the patron might also have been a Florentine with Neapolitan interests (see below). Since Charles could not have carried the arms of Hungary and the Angevin house before the death of Louis the Great, the cassone cannot have been commissioned before September 1382.The origin and culture of the artist of this remarkable cassone front have been much discussed, but it is generally agreed that he was trained in Florence. Whether he actually worked in Naples and possibly Spain (Bologna 1975 and Leone de Castris 2011) remains hypothetical. Several other works by the same artist, including a stylistically related cassone with scenes from Boccaccio’sDecameron, are in Florence (the cassone is in the Museo Nazionale del Bargello). Moreover, in the church of San Martino a Mensola, near Florence, is a casket decorated by the same artist as well as an altarpiece. Inscriptions date the casket to 1389 and the altarpiece to 1391. The altarpiece includes a rare depiction of Saint Henry of Hungary, thus suggesting—like the cassone (which was purchased in Florence)—a patron with Hungarian ties. Fahy (1994) has suggested identifying the artist with the Florentine painter Francesco di Michele, but his proposal has not been universally accepted (Leone de Castris 2011). The five dated works by this artist range in time from 1385 to 1395 and thus coincide with the activity of the Master of Charles of Durazzo.Keith Christiansen 2011",

        "Intro Description": "Painted in Florence about 1400, this elaborately decorated front of a chest (cassone) recounts in three episodes the conquest of Naples by Charles III of Durazzo, who defeated the forces of Otto of Brunswick in 1381. At the right, the armies clash; in the center, Otto's troops (recognizable by their distinctive haircut) surrender to Charles; at the left, the victors enter the conquered city. The prominent pennants and coats of arms in the spandrels are those of the Durazzo and the kings of Hungary. For more information about this painting, visit metmuseum.org.",

He made numerous portraits of members of the imperial family and the Viennese aristocracy. He was appointed assistant director of the Academy in 1783 and director of the Imperial Gallery in 1806. Füger was also a distinguished and successful painter in oils and pastels.The miniature has been mistakenly described as a portrait of the empress Maria Ludovika (1787–1816), who married Franz II (1768–1835) of Austria in 1808. It is instead a reduced version of the portrait of the empress Maria Louisa by Füger of which the prime version shows her holding a miniature of her husband, Leopold II (Ernst Lemberger,Portrait Miniatures of Five Centuries, London, [1913], colorpl. 9). In that miniature the empress wears an ermine-lined cloak. There is another miniature ascribed to Füger in which she wears the same slashed sleeves and her husband's portrait pinned to her breast (Ferdinand Laban, \"Heinrich Friedrich Füger, der Porträtminiaturist,\"Jahrbuch der Königlich Preuszischen Kunstsammlungen26 [1905], fig. 19).Maria Louisa of Spain (1745–1792), daughter of Charles III, king of Spain and of Naples and Sicily, married in 1765 Leopold (1747–1792), grand duke of Tuscany, becoming archduchess of Austria and in 1790—the approximate date of this miniature—Holy Roman Empress.[2016; adapted from Reynolds and Baetjer 1996]",

        "Notes": "The date inscribed on the painting appears to be incorrect. Monet often returned to finished paintings and dated them well after their completion. This work was painted in 1866–67 during Monet's visit to the coast of Normandy. A pair of Manet paintings—The \"Kearsarge\" at Boulogne(The Met 1999.442) andThe Battle of the \"Kearsarge\" and the \"Alabama\"(Philadelphia Museum of Art), exhibited in 1865 and 1867—show that they had a clear influence over Monet in painting this picture.",
        "Intro Description": "When this early seascape debuted at the 1879 Impressionist exhibition, a critic remarked that it was \"directly influenced by Manet.\" The handling of paint and the composition, especially the high horizon line, echo Manet's depictions of American warships,The \"Kearsarge\" at Boulogne(1999.442) andThe Battle of the \"Kearsarge\" and the \"Alabama\"(Philadelphia Museum of Art), which Monet may have seen on exhibition in Paris in 1865 and 1867. He later—and incorrectly—dated the present work to 1865. In fact, he visited the Normandy coast in 1866 and 1867.",

        "Notes": "This picture is one of about ten known bust-length images of Christ in a number of poses painted by Rembrandt pupils during the 1650s. Other versions of the subject include compositions at the Fogg Museum, Cambridge; Detroit Institute of Arts; Museum Bredius, The Hague;  Philadelphia Museum of Art; a work formerly in Tilburg; and one in the Gemäldegalerie, Berlin (considered to be perhaps authentic). The Met's work is slightly larger than these examples, which are all about the same size (about 25 x 20 cm), and is the only one on canvas. Its support was cut down and mounted on a slightly larger canvas at an early date. It may have been originally the same size as the version formerly in the Harry John collection, Milwaukee, and sold at Sotheby's, New York, January 11, 1996, no. 261.Three examples of this subject, one described as \"Een Christus tronie nae't leven\" (\"a head of Christ done from life,\" that is, from a model probably found in the Jewish quarter of Amsterdam), were cited in the 1656 inventory of the artist's possessions (nos. 115, 118, and 326).Bode (1883) identifies this work with one in the Saulcy collection in Paris, but the Philadephia version is more likely to be the ex Saulcy picture.",
        "Intro Description": "Rembrandt painted this subject a number of times; three examples, one described as \"Een Christus tonie nae't leven\" (\"a head of Christ done from life,\" that is, from a model probably found in the Jewish quarter of Amsterdam), were cited in the 1656 inventory of the artist's possessions. Of the dozen bust-length portraits of Christ known today, only the small panel in Berlin is universally accepted, but several others are obviously the work of pupils. The present picture, which is sensitive both in conception and execution, must be either by Rembrandt or by one of his most gifted followers. The issue, as so often is the case, is complicated by the fact that the paint surface has been flattened and badly abraded.",

        "Technical Notes": "Bullfight in a Divided Ringis painted in oil on a reused canvas depicting the coat of arms of King Charles III of Spain, and heraldic symbols associated with the city of Madrid (see fig. 1 above). The artist chose a red orange priming layer to cover the coat of arms before painting the present composition. The colored priming, which consists of a mixture of lead white and vermilion, is visible throughout where the paint is thinly applied.Infrared reflectography (IRR) visually enhances the rapid and gestural painting technique used forBullfight in a Divided Ringin which the artist employs freely brushed drawing in black paint throughout (fig. 2). IRR also reveals extensive underdrawing executed in a fluid black paint applied with a brush. This is not a resolved composition but rather a series of loose sketches of individual figures and groups of figures. Although the underdrawing does not correspond and is larger in scale than the figures in the final composition, both appear to be by the same hand. Some of the features of the coat of arms are apparent in the IRR.The coat of arms revealed in the x-radiograph is correctly oriented with the composition rotated clockwise (figs. 3–4). Cusping of the fabric support visible along the perimeter indicates that the painting of the coat of arms retains its original dimensions. Depicted on the shields bottom left and right are two heraldic symbols associated with the city of Madrid, a bear stretching to eat the fruit of a strawberry tree (madroño), and a winged griffin. The scanning x-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis of Research Scientist Silvia A. Centeno provides a mapping of elements used to paint the coat of arms. By superimposing the XRF maps on top of the x-radiograph, it is possible to obtain an accurate color image (fig. 5). Yellow is assigned to the element Au (gold); red is assigned to Hg (mercury), which is an element in the red pigment vermillion; blue is assigned to Cu (copper), which is an indication of a blue or green pigment.Dorothy Mahon 2020",

Kostyrko.The Journal of a Transatlantic Art Dealer: René Gimpel 1918–1939. London, 2017, p. 259.Master Paintings: Evening Sale.  Sotheby's, New York.  February 1, 2018, p. 161, under no. 48.",
        "Notes": "The Met'sBullfight in a Divided Ringwas long considered one of the \"four pictures of equal size\" from the first entry of the inventory of paintings drawn up following the death of the painter's wife, Josefa Bayeu, in 1812, all of which became the property of Goya's son, Javier (first published in Sánchez Cantón 1946). However, this picture, which is now considered to be a pastiche, is probably not one of the original four listed in the inventory, and is indeed no longer considered an autograph work.TheProcession in Valencia(Foundation Bührle, Zurich), which is listed as the pendant to our picture in the 1867 and 1875 Salamanca sale catalogues, bears an inventory mark \"X 1\" while our picture lacks the mark (x-ray, January 15, 1973). Salas (\"Sur les tableaux de Goya qui appartinrent à son fils,\"Gazette des beaux-arts63 [February 1964]) proposed that Goya's son added the mark to indicate the pictures in the artist's studio which belonged to him. The \"X\" referred to his initial as he then spelled his name \"Xavier,\" though the mark was subsequently removed from a number of paintings. The other two paintings which have been identified with the first entry areThe Greasy Pole(orThe Maypole) (formerly Duque de Tamanes, Madrid, present location unknown), which is also marked \"X 1,\" andCarnival(Bousquet collection, Paris), which is not. Recent scholarship has cast doubt on the authenticity of the paintings bearing this inventory mark (see Wilson-Bareau 1996 and 2003).The Met'sBullfightrelates to a number of Goya's paintings and prints which may have served as its sources. These includeBullfight in a Village(Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando, Madrid; Gassier and Wilson 1971, no. 969; Gudiol 1971, no. 465),The Divided Ring(Ashmolean Museum, Oxford; Gassier and Wilson 1971, no. 1675; Gudiol 1971, no. 759), and the lithographBullfight in a Divided Ring(Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando, Madrid; Gassier and Wilson 1971, no. 1710; Gudiol 1971, fig. 1263). The print is one of a series of bullfight lithographs known asLes Taureaux de Bordeaux. The exhibition \"Goya: Toros y toreros,\" Arles and Madrid, 1990 (see Gassier 1990), discusses more fully Goya's treatment of the theme in various media.An etching by Daniel Mordant after this work appeared in the 1889 sale catalogue of the Dreyfus collection, and was reproduced without attribution in Lafond 1901.",
        "Intro Description": "Goya treated the theme of bullfighting in a number of paintings, in a celebrated series of prints—theTauromaquia, published in 1816—and in four lithographs published in Bordeaux in 1825, when he was in exile. During the mid-nineteenth century there was a brisk business in copies of Goya's popular bullfight compositions, and the use here of certain motifs that appear in Goya's other bullfight scenes has led some authorities to view our painting as a pastiche by another hand. The richness of the composition however, and the brilliant handling of the foreground crowd are worthy of Goya himself. The painting arrived in Paris as part of a Spanish private collection by 1867.",

        "Catalogue Entry": "Formerly assigned to Willem van de Velde the Younger (1633–1707), this painting was reattributed in 1973 to Peter Monamy, known for his marine paintings, who may have been associated with the Van de Velde studio. One of Van de Velde’s autograph late works, signed and dated 1703 (National Maritime Museum, Greenwich), illustrates a similar ship and displays the greater variety and facility of that artist’s figural style, so different from what is seen here. The attribution to Monamy, suggested in 1963, was reaffirmed several times by M. S. Robinson (1963, 1964, 1971), formerly Curator of Paintings at the National Maritime Museum, Greenwich. He pointed out that Willem the Younger died in 1707, well before the accession of George I in 1714 and the adoption of the royal Hanoverian standard with the running white horse, which is depicted here.The three-decker ship flies the admiralty flag at the fore and the Union flag at the mizzen in addition to the Hanoverian standard at the main. The crimson flag of the lord high admiral would have been understood at the time as a potent symbol of the British claim to sovereignty of the seas. Although the stern of the great vessel is similar to that of theRoyal William, that ship cannot be identified with certainty as the one shown here because it was laid up throughout the period under consideration. Robinson (1971) believed that Monamy had been inspired instead by the putting to sea of the newBritanniain 1734.The flagship depicted fires a salute to port, while a barge pulls away under its stern. The orderly repetition of the rowers suggests the precise timing that would have been expected of them, but their identical silhouettes—practically a Monamy trademark—show a certain lack of imagination. The composition is typical, as is the profile of the ship’s stern against the white plumes of smoke. A similar painting by Monamy (private collection), with the stern of the same ship and a royal yacht moving away, was exhibited at Leggatt Brothers, London, in 1970.[2010; adapted from Baetjer 2009]",

        "Notes": "Together with anAscension, aSaint Vincent, anEntombment, aNoli Me Tangere(all Hispanic Society, New York), and aFlagellation(now lost), these panels have been identified with a retable from the church of San Juan del Hospital (the church of the Knights of Saint John of Jerusalem) in Valencia, where they were purchased by J. Bruyn Andrews (the pieces cited above passed to Andrews's son, C. B. Andrews, and thence to Viscount and Viscountess Lee of Fareham prior to acquisition by the Hispanic Society). The coats of arms (gules, a griffon rampant or) are those of Vicente Gil, who probably commissioned the retable and whose will dates from 1428. Two masters seem to have been involved. One was almost certainly Miguel Alcañiz. The other, author of the central Ascension, was probably the Master of the Bambino Vispo, who, according to the most recent hypothesis, is to be identified as Gherardo Starnina (born about 1354, died before 1413).",
        "Intro Description": "These panels, from an altarpiece for the Valencian church of San Juan del Hospital, are among the earliest works of Miguel Alcañiz, an artist whose style is marked by the presence of Gherardo Starnina during the 1390s. The influence of Starnina’s lyrical Florentine manner on that of the younger Spanish painter is unmistakable, especially in the brightly colored scenes of Christ casting demons from heaven and sending his apostles to evangelize the world. These unusual depictions of spiritual conquest are fitting subjects for a church of the Hospitallers, an order of monk-knights dedicated to both warfare and charity.",

        "Artist:": "Pietro Longhi (Pietro Falca) (Italian, Venice 1701–1785 Venice)",
        "Date:": "1746",
        "Medium:": "Oil on canvas",

        "Object Number:": "14.32.2",
        "Catalogue Entry": "Pietro Longhi was renowned in Venice for his small paintings representing scenes of everyday life. These were often salacious and depicted love stories, even though no particular narrative was presented and it is unlikely that these works would have had any moral commentary. The paintings often appeared in series and, again, these habitually did not follow a specific theme. Such paintings were avidly collected by patrician families, and the theatrical comic writer Carlo Goldoni praised Longhi’s work.Within a Venetian aristocratic palace, under the watchful presence of a family portrait, a lady presides over her small court. Behind her, standing in a coat, is her husband, presumably returning to the house or in the process of leaving. Next to him is the music or dance instructor of the lady, and sitting to her right is the family chaplain. On the other side is the lady’s youngcavalier servente(escort) who is feeding a small lap-dog with aciambella, a small piece of cake. To the right is a beautiful still life of books arranged over a carpet. For a discussion of the theme, see Bagemihl 1988.This painting, together with three others at The Met (14.32.1,17.190.12,36.16), is said to have been a part of a larger set of canvases by Longhi. It has been proposed (Volpi 1917) that the artist painted twenty pictures for the Gambardi family in Florence, and that the last member of the family left half of the set to the marchese Freschi in Padua and the other half to the conte Miari de’ Cumani in Padua. Out of the ten Freschi canvases, two are supposed to be in the National Gallery, London (An Interior with Three Women and a Seated ManandThe Exhibition of a Rhinoceros in Venice), and two others in the Pinacoteca di Brera, Milan (The Little ConcertandThe Tooth Puller). These two pairs, however, are different in format from each other. The Met's four paintings, instead, were sold by conte Giacomo Miari de’ Cumani in 1912–13. He was said to have owned ten paintings by Longhi, four of which are at The Met, and six of which were in the collection of Elia Volpi in Florence and later in that of Lionello Perera in New York, before being dispersed at two sales: four were sold at Sotheby’s, London, on June 24, 1964 (nos. 31–34) and two were sold at Sotheby’s, London, on April 19, 1967 (nos. 18–19). Documentation in The Met's archives, however, suggests that conte Miari owned fourteen canvases by Longhi, and not ten. He commissioned copies of the paintings he sold, but these works are still untraced. Four of the Miari canvases were sold to Carlo Balboni who, together with Antonio Carrer, sold them to The Met. Of these four, two (14.32.1 and 14.32.2) were exhibited at the Museum, while two were sold to J. Pierpont Morgan (17.19.12) and Henry Walters (36.16), before eventually returning to the Museum separately. Of the six remaining paintings that were sold in 1964 and 1967, three are theArtist Sketching an Elegant Company(Norton Simon Museum, Pasadena),The Quack Doctor(Los Angeles County Museum of Art), andThe Card Players(Alte Pinakothek, Munich). Three more (A Gentleman and his Wife Taking Chocolate,A Musical Party,A Girl Dancing at a Picnic) are currently untraced. During relining in 1952 the signature and date of the painting (Pietrus Longhi 1746) was revealed on the back of the original canvas. It is now invisible after relining. All four paintings at The Met have matching eighteenth-century Venetian frames, supporting their origin from the same set of canvases.Xavier F. Salomon 2011",

        "Frame": "The frame (see figs. 1–4 above), one of a pair (with14.32.1), is from Venice and dates to about 1746. This delicate variant of a Salvator Rosa (1615–1673) type frame is made of pine and has half-lap construction with a mitred face. The early water gilding with its distinctive luster includes a pale gold leaf applied to an orange-colored bole on a thin gesso layer. The sight edge is ornamented with applied carving of pierced acanthus leaf and husk. A gentle ogee rises to a step before a swept astragal top edge. A hollow on the outside falls back to rakedknullornament at the back edge which emerges from center points. This frame is original to the painting and the style is associated with the artist. Slight variations to the scale of the ornament occur on the two other frames (17.190.12and36.16) in this series of four.Timothy Newbery with Cynthia Moyer 2017; further information on this frame can be found in the Department of European Paintings files",

The title Duchess of Gloucester was added to some of these copies, possibly in order to make them more salable. Maria Walpole, Duchess of Gloucester during the period in question, sat for Gainsborough twice: after her first husband’s death in 1763, as the widowed Countess Waldegrave (Los Angeles County Museum of Art), and in the 1770s, as the Duchess of Gloucester (Taft Museum of Art, Cincinnati).

        "Notes": "On the occasion of the Vatican exhibition in 1982, this picture and its companion,The Massacre of the Innocents(58.189.1), were examined side by side with two pictures in the collection of the Pinacoteca Vaticana, Vatican City:The NativityandThe Flight into Egypt. Tooling, technique, costumes, and other details all corresponded, and it was determined that there can be no reasonable doubt that all four panels come from the same predella. John Pope-Hennessy suggested that this predella may have belonged to the altarpiece ofThe Purification of the Virginformerly in the cathedral at Massa Marittima (destroyed 1922), where many of the figures types recur.This work dates from about 1470.",
        "Intro Description": "Together with two scenes now in the Vatican, these panels formed the base (predella) of an altarpiece, possibly thePresentation in the Templein the cathedral of Massa Marittima, south of Siena. Sano was a gifted painter of illuminations and these works share with his illuminations a pleasing, genial, if somewhat conservative, narrative style. His work was much appreciated by the Franciscan order in Siena for its simple, populist character.",

        "Catalogue Entry": "The Artist:For the full overview of the artist’s career, seeSaint Francis(2003.281). Although Barocci was, above all, a groundbreaking creator of altarpieces and devotional works, he was also accomplished as a portraitist. In this arena he did almost all of his work for his patron in Urbino, Duke Francesco Maria II della Rovere, his family, and his court. Giovan Pietro Bellori, the artist’s earliest biographer (1672), mentioned a few of his sitters—friends as well as nobles and ecclesiastics—all of them directly tied to the court at Urbino (see Emiliani 2008, vol. 1, p. 67). The most spectacular of Barocci’s portraits shows the duke in armor (the breastplate of which is owned by The Met (2008.638.2)) with his helmet and shield (Galleria degli Uffizi, Florence; another version is in the collection of the Duke of Northumberland, Alnwick Castle). Barocci probably painted it around 1571–72, after the duke bravely fought in the battle of Lepanto against the Ottomans. Other significant portraits include the considerably laterPortrait of Monsignor Giuliano della Rovere(Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna) which shows the duke’s cousin seated in a study wearing a clerical garment that shimmers in the light, and the statelyPortrait of Count Federico Bonaventura(Embassy of Italy, London), dated 1602. Barocci seems to have produced very few smaller or less formal portraits, although his sketch-likeSelf-Portrait(Galleria degli Uffizi, Florence), painted around 1595–1600, demonstrates a remarkable strength of observation. Among his rare portraits of women is aPortrait of a Young Girl(Galleria degli Uffizi, Florence), sometimes identified as Lavinia della Rovere, that is likewise bust length, and in which the artist focused with great tenderness on the girl’s face, her soft hair, and white ruff. Usually dated about 1575, theYoung Girlis painted with the delicacy of Barocci’s devotional art of that time, such as theMadonna of the Cat(National Gallery, London).The Painting:In this recently rediscovered work, Barocci paints the young sitter bust-length in an elaborately worked dark jerkin or doublet with a starched, high white ruff. His carefully groomed moustache and beard are a variation on those seen in the portrait of Duke Francesco Maria (whose cheeks are not smooth-shaven), and probably reflect a style at the court. In its simultaneous delicacy and precision of touch, seen for example in the shape and outline of the eyes, it resembles the works from the 1570s mentioned above. At the same time, the greater clarity and solidity with which the grand ruff has been painted could suggest a somewhat later date for this very fine portrait of a still-unidentified young man.Although the painting’s earliest provenance is not known, an old label on the back of the canvas reveals that in the mid-nineteenth century it was in an illustrious Neapolitan collection, that of Giacomo Lazzari. Lazzari’s collection was inventoried in 1843, and the portrait appears there as \"Barocci, Federico. Ritratto d’uomo, di palmi due per due e mezzo, per alto\" (see Aloisio 1843). The collection was sold in 1850. Antonello da Messina’sChrist Crowned with Thorns(32.100.82) also belonged to the Lazzari collection.Andrea Bayer 2017",

        "Intro Description": "The most innovative painter of his generation, Barocci enjoyed the patronage of Duke Francesco Maria della Rovere in Urbino, the capital of the region known as the Marches. This unidentified, refined young man, painted in the 1570s, is most likely from the Duke’s circle. The artist sought to depict his sitters in the most natural way, thus getting away from the stiff artificiality of many Italian portraits at mid-century. As with all of Barocci’s memorable paintings, his portraits broke new ground and were influential on the most important artists active early in the next century.",

        "Notes": "Repin was a subject of the Russian Empire until it ended in 1917 and then a resident of Finland until his death in 1930. He also had strong Ukrainian biographical and cultural ties during a period of growing Ukrainian national consciousness. As a result, his national identities are complex. The Department of European Paintings currently describes Repin as \"Ukrainian, born Russian Empire,\" to reflect the dual intersecting nationalities identified in scholarship on the artist.The city where Repin lived from 1889 to 1930, Kuokkala, was part of the Grand Duchy of Finland, a self-governing part of the Russian Empire, until the Russian Revolution in 1917, when the town was absorbed within independent Finland. Kuokkala became part of the Soviet Union in the 1940s. It was renamed Repino, in honor of Repin, in 1948, and is now considered part of St. Petersburg.On Repin’s national identities, see Thomas M. Prymak, \"A Painter from Ukraine: Ilya Repin,\"Canadian Slavonic Papers / Revue Canadienne des Slavistes55, nos. 1–2 (March–June 2013), pp. 19–43. Prymak considers the arguments for the artist’s Ukrainian and Russian national identities. See also Leigh 2022.Vsevolod Mikhailovich Garshin was born on his family’s estate, \"Pleasant Valley,\" in the Bakhmut district of Ekaterinoslav province in the Russian Empire, an area now in eastern Ukraine. He came from a noble Russian military family that traced its lineage to a prince in the Mongol khanate. Many Russian nobles had estates in the southern part of the Russian Empire, in present-day Ukraine. He moved to St. Petersburg for schooling at about eight or nine years of age.In 1877, Garshin volunteered for service in the Russo-Turkish War and was wounded in battle that summer. The experience inspired the publication later that year ofFour Days, a short story about a wounded soldier that made Garshin famous. He continued to publish short stories, often about war, madness, and evil, until shortly before his death.Repin met the author Garshin in 1882. Garshin was the subject of an 1883 portrait by the artist, used as a study for the son inCzar Ivan the Terrible with the Body of His Son(both State Tretyakov Gallery, Moscow). The Met's portrait may also have influenced the face of the returning exile in Repin's paintingThey Did Not Expect Him(1884, Tretyakov Gallery; see Valkenier 1993). A copy of The Met's portrait is in the Garshin Collection of the Moscow Literary Museum (see Henry 2000, vol. 2, p. 89).",
        "Intro Description": "Repin was born in the Ukrainian town of Chuhuiv (Chuguev) when it was part of the Russian Empire. He went on to become a major progressive painter. In the early 1880s, he met Garshin, an acclaimed writer who shared his concern for contemporary political and social problems. Repin made several portraits in this decade of artists in his orbit in Moscow and St. Petersburg. The rich tonal contrasts and lush brushwork are indebted to art he saw while studying in Paris. Four years after this picture was painted, Garshin, scarred by the suicides of his father and brother and his own mental illness, threw himself down a stairwell and died.",

        "Catalogue Entry": "The Artist:For a biography of Hans Memling, see the Catalogue Entry forThe Annunciation(17.190.7).The Painting:The Virgin offers an apple to the Child, which refers to the fruit given by Eve to Adam that led to the downfall of man. This motif indicates the Virgin’s role as the second Eve and Christ’s as the second Adam and future redeemer of humankind. If not an independent panel, this work may have had a pendant of a donor shown praying toward the Virgin and Child, or it may have been the central panel of a triptych.Attribution and Date:Barbara Lane (2009) noted that this painting is a good example of work produced by Memling’s workshop assistants to answer the demand of the open market. This painting is a standard devotional type that was frequently produced by the Memling workshop in Bruges. In fact, the painting bears a strong similarity, in reverse, to the left wing of Memling’s Maarten van Nieuwenhove diptych from 1487 (Sint-Janshospitaal, Bruges; see fig. 1 above). It is also very similar, again in reverse, to Memling’sVirgin and Childof about 1486 in the Museu Nacional de Arte Antiga, Lisbon (fig. 2).It is likely that an even more closely related prototype by Memling existed at some point—in this painting and some variants the Child plays with his big toe, a gesture which is not included in the Bruges or Lisbon paintings. A similar version in the Szépmüvézeti Múzeum, Budapest, has been ascribed to both Jan Provost and Michel Sittow, who may have apprenticed in Memling’s workshop.[1] Another version with the Child placed at the left, looking right, attributed to Juan de Flandes, is in a private collection. The Met’s collection includes two other, similar, half-length Virgin and Child paintings from the workshop of Memling (see32.100.58and1975.1.111) that are not painted in as skilled a manner as this version, although the version from the Friedsam collection (32.100.58) was likely produced in Memling’s workshop.[2]The sense of volume conveyed in this painting indicates that the workshop assistant was relatively skilled, but it does not demonstrate the meticulous execution of works by Memling himself. Most versions of this composition include a parapet or strip of wall at the bottom of the scene that is not included here. However, the support of The Met's painting was not cut down; an unpainted edge exists at all four sides. Photographic documentation from the turn of the twentieth century (European Paintings archive files) suggests that in a previous situation the painted composition extended onto the now-lost frame. Such compositional strategies are consistent with painters active in the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries.Examination with infrared reflectography has revealed that there is no evidence of a mechanical means of design transfer in the underdrawn layer; it seems that the design was freely drawn after a workshop drawing (fig.3). However, the underdrawing is confined to the contours of forms, which is characteristic of copies.[3] Some adjustments were made in the painted layers, which were applied in a technique consistent with early-sixteenth-century practice. This can be seen especially in the broader use of lead white paint, illustrated in the x-radiograph (fig. 4) and discussed in the Technical Notes. The figures possess a marble-like hardness, generated not only through the use of grey and white paint, but also through the dark contour lines present throughout the painting. Based on this analysis of painting technique, it is likely that the artist of this painting was not a member of Memling’s workshop but a follower active in Bruges in the opening decades of the sixteenth century.Nenagh Hathaway 2017[1] See Silva Maroto 2006, pp. 85–89; Urbach 2015, pp. 236–44; and Weniger 2011, pp. 134–36.[2] See Sprinson de Jesús 1998.

        "Technical Notes": "Support:The support is a single oak plank, with the grain oriented vertically. Dendrochronological analysis indicated an earliest possible creation date of 1352 with a more plausible date of 1358 upwards. The wood originated in the Baltic/Polish region.[1]The support, retaining its original thickness, measures 7/16 inch (1.1 cm) thick. Roughly hewn tool marks, aged white ground and black paint are evident on the back. In the unpainted wood margin, there are traces of at least two different sets of early nails. There are rectangular nail holes from a nail entering the front of the panel, likely from the engaged frame being nailed onto the painted panel. There are traces of a second set of rectangular nails that were located along the left and right sides of the panel, and would have secured a frame into the edges.Preparation:The panel was prepared with a white ground. The presence of abarbeand unpainted margins along all edges indicate that the original dimensions are preserved and that the panel was prepared in an engaged frame.Examination with infrared reflectography revealed that many of the contours were underdrawn using a dry crumbly material (see fig. 3 above).[2] In addition, a dilute liquid material appears to have also been used around the eyes of both figures. Few adjustments were made to the underdrawn composition, mainly restricted to slight adjustments that served to plump out the thin limbs of the child and shorten the elongated fingers of the Virgin.Paint layers:The handling is accomplished, but the artist’s liberal use of grey and white paint in the fleshtones dark contours lines imparted a hardness to the composition. Close examination revealed that the artist used grey paint to create shadow and much lead white throughout the fleshtones, giving them the cool hardness of marble, as opposed to the selected use of whites and warm glazes characteristic of Memling’s fleshtones. This use of black paint is also evident in the infrared reflectogram and of lead white in the x-radiograph (fig. 4).The artist has used dark contour lines throughout, from fine lines at the eyes to a few instances of bolder touches, most strikingly along the proper left edge of the Virgin’s neck, below the Child’s chin and along the Child’s left ear and throughout the drapery. These strong contour lines give the composition a crispness not characteristic of Memling’s technique. Altogether the painting technique points to a slightly later conception of paint handling.The technique of painting imparts an unnatural solidity to the Virgin’s hair. Tendrils were first blocked in, with a few individual strands picked out to create the waves. On the other hand, the Child’s hair received a more delicate treatment with individual strokes of paint used to create the soft waves of hair.The painting is in good condition. Some vertical cracks, associated with the grain of the wood support, are slightly raised but stable. The green paint—likely copper-containing—has discolored to brown, and the blue of the Virgin’s mantle has darkened. There is some rubbing of the dark glazes, particularly in the Child’s right cheek and eyes. The eyelashes have been reinforced. There is a loss in the Virgin’s proper left eye.Sophie Scully 2017[1] Wood identification and dendrochronological analysis completed by Dr. Peter Klein, Universität Hamburg, dated May 23, 2014. The report can be found in the files of the Department of Paintings Conservation. The youngest heartwood ring was formed out in the year 1341. Regarding the sapwood statistic of Eastern Europe an earliest felling date can be derived for the year 1350, more plausible is a felling date between 1354..1356….1360 +x. With a minimum of two years for seasoning an earliest creation of the painting is possible from 1352 upward. Under the assumption of a median of fifteen sapwood rings and two years for seasoning, as probably usual in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, a creation is plausible from 1358 upward.[2] Infrared reflectography completed with an OSIRIS InGaAs near-infrared camera with a 6-element, 150mm focal length f/5.6–f/45 lens; 900-1700nm spectral response.",

In his youth he finished second to Richard Cosway (see62.49) in a competition held by the Society of Arts in 1755, and he has held that place ever since. Smart's miniatures bear dates from 1760, and he had an extensive clientele. He arrived in India in 1785 and worked there until 1795. He had been a director of the Society of Artists, which had continued in opposition to the Royal Academy. By the time of his return to England, the society was defunct, and Smart exhibited at the Royal Academy until his death in London in 1811. The scope of Smart's art can be studied in a remarkable collection of fifty-one miniatures, one signed and dated for each year from 1760 until 1810, which was given to the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art, Kansas City, by Mr. and Mrs. John W. Starr (John Smart—Miniaturist, exh. cat., Kansas City, 1966).This is a portrait sketch made in preparation for a miniature, about 1770.

        "Catalogue Entry": "Delacroix was not a prolific portraitist, and almost all of his portraits are of intimate friends or members of his family. About the present sitter he reflected, \"Upon waking my thoughts turn to such pleasant and sweet moments held in my memory and in my heart, of times spent close to my aunt in the country\" (Journal, Michèle Hannoosh, ed., vol. 1, p. 758, under April 28, 1854). His portrait of her conveys this affectionate feeling. It is a remarkably tender and human record of someone Delacroix loved dearly. Despite the busy frills of her lace bonnet or the coruscating color of her foulard, the portrait is serene and unspectacular in a way that few of the artist’s works are.Delacroix was related to Mme Riesener through his mother, one of the daughters of the master cabinetmaker Jean François Oeben (1721–1763). When Oeben died, he left his widow (Delacroix’s grandmother) with an unfinished piece of furniture, the celebrated desk of Louis XV now in the Musée du Louvre, Paris, which was eventually completed by Oeben’s assistant Jean Henri Riesener (1734–1806), who signed it in 1769 with his name alone. Before he completed the desk, Riesener married Oeben’s widow, with whom he had a son, Henri François (1767–1828). It is the latter’s wife who is portrayed here.Born Félicité Longrois, the sitter was the granddaughter of Pierre Longrois, who was in charge of the furniture at the Château de la Muette. Through one of her uncles she was introduced to the imperial service, where she became adame d’annonce(lady-in-waiting). Napoleon took a fancy to her, and she became his mistress for a brief period during the winter of 1805–6. During the following summer she was married off to Henri François Riesener, with Empress Josephine signing the prenuptial contract. Riesener was then almost forty years old; his wife not yet twenty (Gavoty 1963, pp. 252–54). Her appearance at this time is recorded in the large double portrait Riesener painted of his fiancée and her sister, which Delacroix unquestionably saw many times (now Musée des Beaux-Arts, Orléans).After the deaths of Delacroix’s father in 1805 and his mother in 1814, the Rieseners were his closest relatives, aside from his sister and a surviving brother, and he often spent his holidays with them in the country at Frépillon near Montmorency, about nine miles north of Paris. He grew devoted particularly to his aunt, and even as an adult frequently stayed with her. In a letter written on August 7, 1832, immediately after he had returned from his trip to North Africa, he expressed how much she meant to him. Proposing to see her within the week, he wrote, \"Suffice it to say, dear aunt, that I have thought of you and of the small number of people whose lives are dear to me\" (Correspondance, ed. André Joubin, Paris, 1935–38, vol. 5, pp. 159–60).It was probably through Mme Riesener’s husband that Delacroix took an interest in painting. A student of Antoine Vestier (1740–1824), Henri Riesener was a successful painter who specialized in Neoclassical portraits. In a letter of July 8, 1820, Delacroix wrote to his sister, Henriette de Verninac: \"M. Riesener [ . . . ] thinks it would be to my advantage to go and study with M. David in Brussels; I have often considered this, but I must think it over still further.\" (Correspondance, vol. 5, p. 61; trans. Jean Stewart,Eugène Delacroix: Selected Letters, 1813–1863, London, 1971, p. 73). It is hard to imagine what course Delacroix’s career would have taken had he followed his uncle’s advice.The Rieseners’ son Léon (1808–1878) also became a painter and a close friend of Delacroix’s, and they were often together at Frépillon. Léon Riesener sat for Delacroix in 1834: the result is a strikingly vivid and handsome portrait (Louvre, Paris) that is not so large or so elaborate as the present work, although it has the same immediacy and betrays a similarly direct rapport between artist and subject. Madame Riesener sat for her portrait shortly after. According to Moreau (1873, p. 236), it was executed at Frépillon in the summer of 1835. Although this is the only evidence for the date, there seems to be no reason to question it. Moreau knew Delacroix personally, and he interviewed the Riesener family when he gathered the material for his monograph, the first book on Delacroix. Moreover, the style of the portrait, as much as one can deduce from comparisons with documented works of 1835, seems plausible for that year, and the apparent age of the sitter also corresponds with this period (Mme Riesener was then a widow, about fifty years old). Some writers claim that the portrait was done in February 1835, since that is the only time during the year when it is certain that Delacroix was at Frépillon, but one need not be so precise, since Delacroix was a regular guest there.[2018; adapted from Fahy 2005]",

His affection for Madame Riesener, an aunt by marriage, is expressed through the frank tenderness of this portrait. She was once known for her beauty: some thirty years before the date of this portrait she served as a lady-in-waiting to empress Josephine, and having caught Napoleon’s eye, engaged in a brief liaison with him. After she died, Delacroix wrote to George Sand, \"each of the beings necessary to our existence who disappears, takes away with him a whole world of feelings that no other relationship can revive.\"",

Trompe l’oeil subjects enjoyed popularity throughout eighteenth- and ninteenth-century Europe. Attributions for this painting have varied, but its similarity to signed and dated paintings in Dijon and Strasbourg suggest Le Motte’s authorship.",
