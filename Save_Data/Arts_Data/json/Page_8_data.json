        "Catalogue Entry": "Bartolomeo Vivarini belonged to one of the most distinguished family workshops in Venice, renowned for the production of altarpieces. While his brother Antonio remained tied to the Gothic tradition, Bartolomeo gradually opened up to the novelties introduced by the Renaissance language.Contrary to what has sometimes been thought, this is not the altarpiece mentioned by Giovambatista Rossetti in hisDescrizione delle pitture, sculture, ed architetture di Padova(1765) as in a chapel of the Certosa in Padua, signed by Bartolomeo Vivarini and inscribed with the date 1475. The painting seen by Rossetti is an earlier work by the Venetian artist, theVirgin Enthroned with Saints, now in the church of Saint Anthony, Veli Lošinj, Croatia. Archival research has demonstrated, instead, that The Met's painting was commissioned by the Carthusians for the altar of Saint Lawrence on March 15, 1484, and that Vivarini promised to execute it within eight months. The two paintings, similar in composition and dimensions, were probably conceived as twin altarpieces facing each other (Sambin 1964).The style ofThe Death of the Virginis representative of Bartolomeo's provincial later period when the influence of his early training with Squarcione, the famous Paduan artist, re-emerged. During the 1480s, in fact, his work became more linear and schematic as visible in the hard modeling of the figures and the use of strident color (Zeri and Gardner 1973). The composition follows precisely the account of the event by the thirteenth-century writer Jacobus de Voragine in theGolden Legend. The Virgin is represented on her death bed surrounded by the eleven apostles who have gathered together from different parts of the world to bury the body of God's mother and to assist in her assumption. Jesus, sitting on his heavenly throne, welcomes the Virgin's soul in the form of a little figure and both are carried away by angels. The two saints on the sides, the proto-martyrs Stephen and Lawrence, do not engage in the narrative but are intended to act as intercessors between the viewer and the sacred scene.Eveline Baseggio 2010",

        "Catalogue Entry": "This painting shows Christ rising to heaven above a compact group of the twelve apostles and the Virgin Mary. Only his feet and lower legs are visible. This Ascension iconography, which emphasizes Christ’s departure by showing him leaving the pictorial space, emerged in art about the turn of the first millennium. Its biblical source is the Acts of the Apostles (1:9): \"While they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight.\"Since 1921, when The Met acquired this work, scholars have noted that the composition borrows from Albrecht Dürer’sAscensionin the Small Passion woodcut series. The general stylistic debt to Dürer is undeniable. Also, the low angle of vision, which creates a dramatic upward lift appropriate to the subject matter, and the strong foreshortening of the apostles’ upturned heads appear to have their source in Dürer’s woodcut. However, the Museum’sAscensiondeparts from Dürer and returns to an earlier tradition in the symmetrical placement of Peter and Mary in the central foreground, a common feature of fifteenth-century depictions. In a divergence from both Dürer and earlier examples, the Museum’s panel omits the standard central mound marked with impressions of Christ’s feet, which alludes to the Mount of Olives, where the event occurred.That the painting is a fragment of a dismantled altarpiece is indicated by the remains of a gray fictive molding at the top, which originally marked the boundary with another scene above. In addition, saw marks across the back suggest that the panel was originally decorated on both sides, and was therefore part of a movable wing. When the altarpiece was taken apart, the larger panel to which this scene belonged must have been sawn apart vertically, to split the front from the back, and then cut horizontally through the fictive framing element.When first published (Helbing 1919), the painting was attributed to Hans Süss von Kulmbach, and all subsequent scholarship has confirmed his authorship. Indeed, the physiognomic types, drapery styles, generally thin application of paint, and graphic approach to form are typical of Kulmbach. Proposals for the reconstruction of the altarpiece to which the panel belonged were proffered by Buchner (1928) and Stadler (1936), and further clarification came when the picture was exhibited among related works in Nuremberg in 1961. But a real breakthrough in the reconstruction occurred when Brandl (1983 and 1984–85) credibly connected the painting to an altarpiece formerly in Nuremberg’s castle (the Burg) that had been described and published by Christoph Gottlieb von Murr (Beschreibung der vornehmsten Merkwürdigkeiten in des H.R. Reichs freyen Stadt Nürnberg und auf der hohen Schule zu Altdorf: nebst einem chronologischen Verzeichnisse der von Deutschen, insonderheit Nürnbergern, erfundenen Künste, vom XIII Jahrhunderte bis auf jetzige Zeiten, Nuremberg, 1778). Murr wrote of a Marian altarpiece in the Walburgis Chapel that displayed a carved Coronation of the Virgin at the center, a Visitation and a scene of \"saints ascend[ing] a stairway\" toward \"a person . . . holding a book\"—surely a Presentation of the Virgin—on the wings, and a Death of the Virgin on the predella. Murr noted that the latter was painted by Kulmbach in 1513, information he probably gained from inscriptions on the frame in the predella area.Murr’s description led Brandl to identify this altarpiece’s shrine as the tabernacle relief of theCoronation of the Virginby a pupil of Veit Stoss that is preserved in the Germanisches Nationalmuseum, Nuremberg. Brandl furthermore proposed that the wings described by Murr are Kulmbach’s narrow panels of theMeeting at the Golden GateandPresentation of the Virginnow in the Museo Thyssen-Bornemisza, Madrid, which are currently attached as wings, falsely it appears, to a Heavenly Rosary by Kulmbach. Murr’s apparent misidentification of theMeeting at the Golden Gateas a Visitation is attributable, Brandl maintained, to the compositional similarities of the two subjects. Building on ideas already proposed by Buchner and Stadler, Brandl considered the altarpiece’s predella to be Kulmbach’sDeath of the Virginin the Staatsgalerie Bamberg and the exterior wing decoration theAnnunciationin the Germanisches Nationalmuseum, Nuremberg; theNativityin the Staatsgalerie Bamberg; theAdoration of the Magiin the Allentown Art Museum; and theAscensionin The Met. With its sculpted shrine, Brandl’s reconstruction decisively rejected the idea, proposed by Stadler but doubted in subsequent literature, of the KulmbachCoronation of the Virginin the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna, as the altarpiece’s center. Problematic, however, was Brandl’s exclusion on stylistic grounds of the four scenes of theBirth of the Virgin,Visitation,Appearance of Christ to His Mother, andPentecostin the Museum der bildenden Künste Leipzig, which Stadler had proposed as belonging to the ensemble. Without the Leipzig panels, the iconographic program in the closed state jumped abruptly and implausibly from scenes of Christ’s infancy to his ascension with nothing in between.A clear idea of the exact distribution of scenes was lacking until Lübbeke (1991) proposed a solution. Noting that the Leipzig scenes are stylistically consistent with the other paintings, she deduced a convincing arrangement based on crucial technical evidence about the states and relative thicknesses of the wood supports. Whereas four of the panels—theAnnunciation,Visitation,Appearance of Christ to His Mother, andAscension—are between .5 and .8 centimeter thick and show saw marks on the backs, which indicate that they were split from their reverses, the other four—theBirth of the Virgin,Nativity,Adoration, andPentecost—are between 1 and 1.5 centimeters thick and show no signs of having been split. The latter, thicker panels must have constituted stationary wings, undecorated on the reverse. The four thinner panels with saw marks on the backs were the exteriors of the movable wings and had been split off the MadridMeeting at the Golden GateandPresentation of the Virgin. This is confirmed by the existence of a vertical crack in corresponding positions on theMeeting at the Golden Gateand theAnnunciationand a knot that aligns on thePresentation of the Virginand theAscension(visible beneath Mary’s shoulder in the x-radiograph; see fig. 1 above). The eight exterior scenes were separated from one another by cutting along the fictive gray framing element whose remnants are found alternately at the panels’ bottoms (Birth of the Virgin,Annunciation,Visitation,Nativity) and tops (Adoration,Appearance of Christ to His Mother,Ascension,Pentecost). This technical evidence perfectly supports Lübbeke’s arrangement of the exterior scenes in two rows of four, running chronologically from the top left to the bottom right. Lübbeke noted further that the presence of stationary wings allows a better fit for the BambergDeath of the Virginas the predella, as it is wider than the central section above. That the Bamberg panel indeed belongs to this ensemble is corroborated by the fact that it, the AllentownAdoration, and the New YorkAscensionremained together in private collections until 1919. Additional support for the connection is found in the heads of two apostles in theDeath of the Virgin, both situated to the right of center, one shown in profile, holding the aspergillum and situla, and the other shown frontally, reaching for the aspergillum. While the head of the clean-shaven profile figure appears in reverse on the kneeling figure at the left edge of theAscension, the head of the figure shown frontally, bald on top with a wide forehead, broad beard and long mustache, matches that of the figure just right of center in the background of theAscension, tilted in the opposite direction. They probably derive from common model drawings used for the commission.Even before Brandl linked these paintings to the altarpiece described by Murr, most authors had dated them within the range 1511–13, based on stylistic comparison to dated works by Kulmbach. This lends credibility to the date of 1513 cited by Murr. As Lübbeke pointed out, we cannot expect Murr to have deduced an attribution and a date based on his own knowledge of Kulmbach, and it is therefore most likely that the artist’s name and the date were displayed on the case or frame near the predella. Thus 1513 can be accepted as the most plausible date for Kulmbach’s paintings for this altarpiece.[2014; adapted from Waterman in Ainsworth and Waterman 2013]",
        "Technical Notes": "The support is composed of two fir boards with the grain oriented vertically; dendrochronological analysis indicated an earliest possible fabrication date of 1496. Saw marks on the reverse indicate that this painting was originally one side of a double-sided work that was cut apart. X-radiography (see fig. 1 above) revealed that a knot beneath Mary’s shoulder and the slightly diagonal join are reinforced with tow. Abarbeand an unpainted wood border along both sides and the bottom indicate that an engaged frame was in place when the white ground preparation was applied. The panel has been reduced at the top, and it displays a moderate convex lateral warp. In 1936 a thick coat of wax was applied to the verso.The condition of the painting is overall fairly good. There are only minor abrasions and losses and some darkening—most apparent in the sky—along the wood grain. The very graphic technique used throughout the composition demonstrates that it was painted by an accomplished draftsman. Fine individual strokes of fluid paint in several hues describe contours, and crisply hatched brushstrokes produce shadows and volume. Those linear touches were made over blended base tones, and the result is a tightly rendered figural group. The many vibrant colors were produced by mixing as well as by applying transparent glazes over opaque underpainting. In some areas the glazes were applied with parallel hatched strokes. The dark green cloak worn by the disciple standing in the center of the composition was painted with a bright yellow underpaint and glazed with a highly saturated green. The lighter portion of his cloak was originally a more vibrant shade of green; it now appears yellowish brown, perhaps because of a degeneration commonly seen in glazes containing copper-green pigments.When the surface was examined with the stereomicroscope, a warm, yellowish priming was visible on top of the ground. Infrared reflectography revealed faint hatching and some lines of underdrawing in the red garments. With the stereomicroscope, in normal light, it was possible to see both the underdrawing and the finely painted lines and hatching that were applied as final touches to define contours and forms.[2013; adapted from German Paintings catalogue]",

The inner wings are The Meeting at the Golden Gate and The Presentation of the Virgin (both Museo Thyssen-Bornemisza, Madrid). The predella is The Death of the Virgin (Bayerische Staatsgemäldesammlungen, Munich; on permanent loan to the Staatsgalerie und Städtische Gemäldesammlungen, Bamberg).

He does not mention The Met's panel specifically, but does describe two scenes that correspond to the panels now in Madrid and notes that below the centerpiece of a sculpted Coronation of the Virgin was a Death of the Virgin by Hans von Kulmbach of 1513.Kulmbach adapted the composition from a woodcut in Dürer's \"Small Passion\" series.",

Only his feet and lower legs, engulfed by clouds, appear at the top, while on the ground the twelve apostles and the Virgin Mary witness his departure. Kulmbach, who trained with Albrecht Dürer, adapted the composition from a woodcut by his teacher. This painting and eight others (now dispersed among various museums) once comprised the wings and base (predella) of an altarpiece devoted to the life of the Virgin, with a sculpture of her coronation as its centerpiece.",

        "Catalogue Entry": "In September 1848 Delacroix fled the social and political unrest in Paris that followed the downfall of King Louis-Philippe by retreating to his country house south of the city at Champrosay (now incorporated into Draveil). There he undertook a series of ambitious flower paintings that he intended to exhibit at the Salon of 1849. Because of the possibility of frost as fall proceeded, he worked quickly and produced five canvases. In addition to the present work, these areBasket of Flowers and Fruit(Philadelphia Museum of Art; Johnson no. 501),A Vase of Flowers on a Console(Musée Ingres, Montauban; Johnson no. 503),A Bed of Marguerites and Dahlias(location unknown; Johnson no. L213), andHydrangeas and Agapanthus by a Pond(location unknown; Johnson no. L214). The Montauban picture was not finished in time for the Salon and the two lost works were withdrawn by the artist, leaving only the New York and Philadelphia paintings, which were joined byWomen of Algiers in their Apartment(Musée Fabre, Montpellier; Johnson no. 382),Othello and Desdemona(National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa; Johnson no. 291) andSyrian Arab with His Horse(private collection; Johnson no. 348).The flowers in the present work have been identified as follows. At the left are elephant head amaranth, and beneath them are a variety of centaurea (perhaps cornflowers). Falling from the basket are dahlias, rudbeckias, daisies, nasturtiums, and roses. The arch is a tropical white morning glory or moonflower, which appears to be invading a shrub with flowers arranged in dense, flat clusters, possibly elderberry. A number of these species were introduced to Europe from India, Africa, and Central and South America beginning in the sixteenth century. (See Ciret and de Font-Reaulx 2017).Delacroix’s enthusiasm for the flower paintings is palpable from his frequent marking of their progress in journal entries and letters, as well as his invitations to friends to view them in his studio before the Salon opening on June 15, 1849. On February 6, for example, he wrote to his friend Constant Dutilleux, \"You were kind enough to talk to me about the flower paintings I am in the process of finishing. I have . . . subordinated the details to the whole as much as possible . . . I have tried to fashion pieces of nature, such as they present themselves to us in gardens, simply by bringing together, within the same frame and in a highly unlikely manner, the greatest possible variety of flowers\" (Correspondance, vol. 2, pp. 372–73; trans. in Pomarède 2001, p. 121). As if to balance his inventiveness with a grounding in nature, on February 14, Delacroix \"[h]ad a long conversation with Jussieu after dinner on the subject of flowers in connection with my pictures; I have promised to visit him in the spring. He is going to show me the greenhouses and will arrange for me to have every opportunity to study there.\" This is a reference to Adrien de Jussieu (1797–1853), head botanist at the Jardin des Plantes, Paris, attesting to the artist’s serious application to this project. Pomarède has, moreover, described the artist’s particular motivation in carrying out these works, an effort to establish himself as a master of subjects in every genre, and \"to revitalize the genre by means of a kind of realism in which stylistic convention and decoration could serve the contemplation of nature—and not the reverse\" (Pomarède 2001, p. 130).Although they were well received by critics, Delacroix never sold the flower paintings, for which he reportedly was asking 1,200 francs apiece in 1849 (Piron 1865, p. 109). He showed this work at the Salon des amis des arts de Bordeaux in 1854 (see Johnson 1986); in his triumphant retrospective at the Exposition Universelle of 1855 (installation photograph published in Trapp 1970, fig. 205); and at an exhibition organized by the dealer Francis Petit at the Galerie du Cercle des Beaux-Arts, Paris, in 1862. It was also included in the artist’s memorial exhibition held at Paris 1864. At the artist’s posthumous sale, a Monsieur Sourigues paid 7,750 francs for this work.Independent still lifes form a relatively small part of Delacroix’s output. Indeed there is a single significant precedent toBasket of Flowersand its companion works, the curiousStill Life with Lobstersof 1826 (Musée du Louvre, Paris). Yet, taking a cue from the grand manner, he often included still lifes in the foregrounds of his figure paintings (for example, theAbduction of Rebecca, The Met 03.30). This sensitivity to tradition was evident to critics at the 1849 Salon: Théophile Gautier claimed that Delacroix had drawn inspiration from the Italian and Spanish tradition, as well as masterpieces by Jean-Baptiste Monnoyer (1634–1699), Jan Davidz. de Heem (1606–1684), and Jan van Huysum (1682–1749). The artist’s aim of mastering and reinvigorating this genre of painting had a direct effect on his aspiring contemporaries. This painting's inclusion in Paris exhibitions between 1849 and 1864 was influential to Courbet and, in turn, Renoir, Monet, and Bazille (see Shackelford 2001, pp. 23–24).The Met owns a pastel study for the present painting (67.187.4; Robaut no.1073).Asher Ethan Miller 2018",

        "Intro Description": "Given the social and political unrest in post-revolutionary Paris, Delacroix retreated to his country house at Champrosay in September 1848. There he undertook a series of flower paintings intended for the Salon of 1849, which he hoped would capture the variety and profusion of garden flowers. Because of the possibility of frost, he worked quickly, producing five canvases. Of these, only two satisfied him sufficiently to be included in the Salon: the present work andBasket of Flowers and Fruit(Philadelphia Museum of Art).",

        "Catalogue Entry": "This picture of the Madonna adoring her sleeping son is universally considered one of the defining early works by Bellini, the greatest painter of fifteenth-century Venice. In its emphasis on a wiry line to define the contours of the figures and configuration of the drapery, the picture shows an obvious debt to Mantegna, who married into the Bellini family. The heavy drapery on the Virgin’s left shoulder is no less reminiscent of the sculpture of Donatello and strongly suggests that the picture was painted after a visit by Bellini to Padua. There he would have had occasion to observe Mantegna’s landmark altarpiece for the church of San Zeno in Verona and to study the bronze sculpture of Donatello for the church of the Santo.While in Padua in 1459 he co-signed an altarpiece with his nephew Gentile and his half-brother, Jacopo Bellini. This painting is therefore likely to date from the years around 1460–64, though it has been dated to the mid-1450s as well. The fact that the picture field has an arched top, much like the devotional works of Jacopo, suggests his enduring influence on Giovanni.Jacopo was formerly believed to be Giovanni’s biological father until documentary evidence revealed him to be his half-brother. Both Giovanni and Jacopo were born to Nicolò Bellini, with Jacopo’s mother being Nicolò’s first wife, Giovannina, and Giovanni’s mother being his second wife, almost certainly Franceschina Vendramin. Jacopo did, however, provide for Giovanni after he was orphaned, raising him as his own son and often referring to him as such. Similarly, Gentile, formerly believed to be Giovanni’s brother, was Giovanni’s biological nephew, though they were raised as brothers and were known as such. Recent documentary discoveries also shed light on the date of Bellini’s birth, which had long remained unknown—it is now dated to 1424–26.[1]The landscape background is notable for the division between flat, planted fields to the right of the Virgin, and to the left an uncultivated one with hills, a winding path, and Roman ruins. Such contrasting landscape backgrounds were standard in Bellini’s work.The motif of the sleeping child has been explained as a premonition of Christ’s death.[2] In an article of 1966, Millard Meiss noted two paintings showing the sleeping Christ that bear inscriptions, one with a verse from the Song of Solomon 5:2 (I sleep but my heart waketh) and the other with a verse urging the Virgin to awaken her child so that the process of redemption can unfold.[3]There is a related composition by Quirizio da Murano in the Accademia, Venice (no. 29). Berenson (1916) cites two other variants by Andrea da Murano: one formerly in the Cannon collection, Fiesole (now Princeton University Art Museum), and one in the sacristy of the Redentore, Venice.The picture has suffered from past overcleaning and in consequence has lost much of its surface refinement.[1] On the genealogy of the Bellini family see Daniel Wallace Maze,Young Bellini, New Haven, 2021 and Daniel Wallace Maze in Davide Gasparotto,Giovanni Bellini: Landscapes of Faith in Renaissance Venice, exh. cat., J.

        "Intro Description": "Asleep beneath the solemn gaze of his mother, the Christ Child’s pose is a reminder of his eventual death and sacrifice. Placed on a ledge that resembles an altar, the child doubles as a symbolic representation of the Eucharist, the Christian rite in which sacramental bread is blessed on an altar and becomes the body of Christ. This work is an important early one by Giovanni Bellini, the greatest painter of fifteenth-century Venice and one of the key figures of European painting. Its hard, linear quality is indebted to the example of Bellini’s brother-in-law, Andrea Mantegna, as well as to the sculpture of Donatello, which Bellini studied in Padua. The picture has suffered from a strong, abrasive cleaning.",

        "Catalogue Entry": "The subject of this painting, which for many years was misunderstood or called uncertain, is a trio of episodes from the story of the Old Testament patriarch Joseph as told in Genesis. Joseph, the favorite son of Jacob, then living in Canaan, was sold by his jealous brothers to Ishmaelite merchants destined for Egypt. Upon arrival in Eqypt, the merchants sold the youth to Potiphar, the captain of Pharaoh’s guard, who eventually made him the overseer of his household. Potiphar’s wife became infatuated with Joseph and attempted to seduce him. He fled from her advances but, in his haste, left behind the cloak that she had grasped to draw him near. In revenge, she accused him of attempting to violate her, presenting Joseph’s cloak to Potiphar as evidence. Potiphar sent Joseph to prison, where he gained a reputation as an interpreter of dreams. Later, when Pharaoh was troubled by dreams whose meaning eluded his advisers, he learned of Joseph’s talent and summoned him from prison. Joseph foretold seven years of bountiful harvests followed by seven years of famine. Pharaoh, grateful for the warning, made Joseph Egypt’s second-in-command and put him in charge of stocking up for the famine.The main, foreground scene in the Museum’s painting represents Joseph interpreting the dreams of Pharaoh (Gen. 41:14–36). Joseph is the figure to the left of center, in profile, bareheaded with shoulder-length, curly brown hair. He wears a billowing white robe adorned with a flower motif. His gestures—left hand raised and right hand pointing—show him in the act of interpretation. Pharaoh, holding a scepter and wearing a crown (on his blue hat), leans far forward in his throne.Two earlier episodes from the Joseph story appear in the background. In the arched window of the next building, Joseph is seen escaping Potiphar’s wife (Gen. 39:7–13). She is at the left, naked except for a white bonnet, and appears to be seated on a bed; the horizontal white streak across her belly must represent a sheet. She leans toward Joseph and clutches his blue cloak. He turns away and flees, holding his right hand to his shoulder, apparently in an attempt to secure the cloak.Beneath the window, in the arched canopy before the entrance to the house, Potiphar’s wife falsely accuses Joseph (Gen. 39:16–19). The blue cloak from the previous scene is draped over a chair or stool and is being examined by a figure wearing a large blue hat similar to that of Pharaoh in the foreground, but without a crown. He is further distinguished from Pharaoh by his lack of a beard. This must be Potiphar. The figure with shoulder-length hair just to the right, shown from behind in yellowish costume, could well be Joseph, given that he is wearing yellow in the scene above and has a yellow sleeve in the foreground scene. The indistinct figure to the left, in the doorway, draped in a purplish robe, was most likely intended to be Potiphar’s wife.Although Colvin (1877) correctly recognized the subject matter in 1877, the feminine appearance of Joseph’s garment in the main scene eventually stirred enough doubt to prompt a shift in the identification to the Justice of Trajan (Emperor Trajan and the Widow), a proposal that was later abandoned, leaving the question of subject unresolved for many years. The ornate robe that caused some scholars to suspect a female protagonist may simply allude to the \"vestures of fine linen (Vulgate: stola byssina)\" (Gen. 41:42) in which Pharaoh dressed Joseph as a reward for the dream interpretation. Moreover, the facial profile of this figure is clearly masculine. The scene of Joseph and Potiphar’s wife in the background, which Colvin also noted and which confirms the subject beyond doubt, appears to have escaped the attention of later scholarship.The Museum’s painting may well have been conceived as part of a series devoted to the story of Joseph, examples of which are known in a variety of media. The materials and technique employed here—a water-based medium on ungrounded fine-weave linen, now referred to by the German termTüchlein—offered a lightweight and economical alternative to both panel paintings and tapestries. Such works on cloth were far more common than their scarcity at the present time would suggest. The disadvantage ofTüchleinpaintings was their susceptibility to deterioration and damage.Several motifs in this picture are traceable to print sources. The dog at the left was copied in reverse from Albrecht Dürer’s woodcutKnight on Horseback and Landsknecht. The guard just to the left of Joseph, shown from behind, combines elements from two Dürer prints. His pose follows, in mirror image, the figure at the right ofChrist Carrying the Crossfrom the Large Passion series, though with the head turned away and one hand made to rest on the hip. The plume on his hat was taken from the corresponding figure in Ecce Homo, the preceding print in the same series. The figure in the immediate right foreground of the painting appears to have been modified in reverse from the striding candle bearer on the left ofThe Circumcisionin Dürer’s Life of the Virgin series. The soldier to the right of Pharaoh inall’antica-style armor appears again, in the main aspects of pose and costume, in the foreground of a NetherlandishCrucifixionof about 1520 in the Gemäldegalerie, Berlin; both probably derive from a common, possibly North Italian, source. The composition and architectural setting may have been inspired by Italian engravings, such as theJudgment Hall of Pilateattributed to Baccio Baldini.The foreground architecture and its classicizing ornament suggest that the Museum’s painting originated in southern Germany. Italianate motifs in German art of this period were not limited to the south, but they were especially prevalent there because of the early, intense interest shown by artists and patrons of Augsburg, which had strong economic ties to Venice. Certainly this work invites comparison with notable examples of classicizing tendencies in Augsburg painting, such as Jörg Breu the Elder’sStory of Lucretiaand Hans Burgkmair the Elder’sStory of Esther, both completed in 1528. The first scholars to associate The Met's Tüchlein with an Augsburg artist were Tietze and Tietze-Conrat (1936), who rightly rejected the old attribution to Lucas van Leyden, which is untenable on stylistic grounds. They proposed an attribution to Jörg Breu the Younger based on similarities with his illustrations dated 1540–41 in a manuscript now at Eton College.The recent publication of Breu’s complete printed oeuvre prompts closer consideration of the artist and lends new plausibility to Breu’s authorship of the Museum’s picture. A survey of hisRiesenholzschnitte(monumental woodcuts) turns up several examples comparable in appearance to the Museum’s painting. Foremost among them are two scenes ofLazarus and the Rich Manwhich, with their perspectivally sound architecture and convincingly proportioned figures, display a grandeur and sophistication consonant with the style of The Met's work. Breu’sDavid and Bathshebais another large woodcut that presents similarly solid figures set in a rationally constructed space; moreover, it makes use of a baldachin-like structure set before a palace that invites comparison with the arched canopy in the background of the painting. Additionally, in aProdigal Sonprint, recently attributed to Breu, the broad, sturdy male faces have the same forceful presence as the most fully realized head in the Museum’s painting, that of the guard on the left edge.If Breu was responsible for this Tüchlein, a date of about 1535 (after taking over management of the workshop from his father) to his death in 1547 is conceivable. Here it must be emphasized, though, that the painting’s unfinished state and damaged condition prevent a comprehensive stylistic analysis. In addition, comparative paintings by and attributed to Breu are scant. The conclusions offered here must therefore remain provisional.[2013; adapted from Waterman in Ainsworth and Waterman 2013]",
        "Technical Notes": "This painting is executed in pigments mixed in a water-soluble glue medium on a fine, plain-weave fabric with no ground preparation. The edges were roughly cut and the painting lined to fabric with an aqueous adhesive and attached to a wooden stretcher. Remnants of an original black-painted border are visible along the perimeter.Because much of the painting was never fully finished, different stages of the painting process remain visible. A straightedge was used to draw the architecture and floor tiles, and the ruled lines were reinforced with black ink or paint. The balance of the composition was also drawn with a dry material and the lines reinforced with black paint. The forms were modeled in black and brown washes heightened with white, which can be seen in the unfinished figures of dogs in the foreground. Other areas where the undermodeling is visible include the face of the man seated on the throne, his robe (where there is also detailed drawing of a floral pattern), and the faces of the figures surrounding him. Some passages, primarily those painted with red, green and blue, have been brought to high level of finish. They include the garlands, canopy, red cloak of the man standing at lower right, red cloaks and tunics of the men standing at left, and green robe of the man standing with arms crossed in the group behind the throne. The costume of the man in armor at right and the green robe and red head scarf of the figure behind him, the blue hat of the seated man, his scepter, his necklaces, and the throne are also finished. Gold was used to accent highlights in the throne.Water damage, discoloration of the fabric support, abrasion throughout the surface, and flake losses in areas where the paint is more thickly applied have diminished the appearance of this very delicate painting. Along the bottom and left side and at the top left corner the paint is damaged and the surface is severely stained. Those areas have been restored, using pastels in order to respect the matte surface. Despite its unfinished and damaged state, the painting can still be appreciated as a beautiful and rare example of the distemper-on-linen (tüchlein) technique.[2013; adapted from German Paintings catalogue]",

        "Catalogue Entry": "Rosalba Carriera was born in Venice, probably in 1673. She corresponded with Benedetto Luti (1666–1724) and with the miniaturist Felice Ramelli (1666–1740), but was probably largely self-taught. According to tradition, she first painted the inside covers of snuff boxes, then independent portrait miniatures, and later pastels. She was admitted to the Accademia di San Luca, Rome, in 1705. Her clientele comprised the aristocracy of Venice, princes of the courts of Europe, and prominent connoisseurs of many different nationalities. In 1720–21, during a visit to Paris, she painted Louis XV (1710–1774) as a child, and she was received into the French Académie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture. In 1723 she was invited to the ducal court of Modena, in 1730 to the imperial court in Vienna; Friedrich August II (1797–1854) of Saxony and Poland formed the most important collection of her work, part of which is still at the Gemäldegalerie, Dresden. As a miniaturist and as a pastellist, Carriera developed techniques that brought these art forms to new heights and she was widely acclaimed.Gustavus Hamilton was Irish, born in 1710, and succeeded his grandfather in 1723 as second Viscount Boyne. This elegant young gentleman made his Grand Tour of the continent with Edward Walpole (1706–1784), the second son of the powerful Whig Prime Minister Sir Robert Walpole (1676–1745). The two were in Venice from late January to March 1730, doubtless for the Carnival season, and Boyne was there again the following winter. There are three versions of the present portrait by Carriera: the second (private collection) shows the sitter in an identical costume, while the third (Barber Institute of Arts, University of Birmingham, England) shows him wearing a brown brocaded coat. All three would have resulted from the sittings for whichever pastel was painted first and all probably date within a year. The entire costume, tricorne hat, lace veil, and mask, worn outdoors with a black coat, is known to Venetians as the bautta and offered its wearer the advantage of anonymity; it was worn by both residents and visitors to the lagoon city.Transporting pastels was a risky business, but a necessary danger given Carriera's international clientele. She was known to have enclosed asantino(a small printed religious image) with her works, presumably intended to safeguard them from damage or loss as they traveled. In 2021, prompted by a research visit by Xavier Salomon to The Met, a small, printed image of the Three Magi was uncovered (see figs. 1, 2 above). It had been meticulously folded into the lower left corner of the pastel's stretcher—presumably untouched since it was placed behind there by Carriera herself around 1730, before she sent her work to the sitter's family in England.[Katharine Baetjer 2010; updated David Pullins 2021]",

        "Intro Description": "Carriera became an international celebrity for her pastel portraits, leading her to tour European capitals and courts in the 1720s and 1730s. She was based in her native city of Venice, where she produced portraits particularly of international visitors. This is one of the most exuberant and well preserved of her works from this period. The Irishman Gustavus Hamilton visited Venice in the winters of 1730 and 1731 with his friend Edward Walpole, son of the English prime minister, to attend the city’s Carnival festivities. Hamilton wears the combined hat, veil, mask, and short cape, known as abautta, typical for these celebrations.",

        "Catalogue Entry": "Tiepolo’s sketch is part of the original group of paintings purchased by the Museum in 1871. It was among the canvases by Tiepolo that Henry James (1872) saw in New York and defined as \"tardy fruit of the Venetian efflorescence\". The painting first appears in the 1830 exhibition catalogue of the collection of the English dealer Richard Abraham, where it is documented as having belonged to J. Taylor, and is called \"a finished sketch\" and described as representing \"the presentation of banners, after a conquest, to one of the Roman Emperors, who is seated on his throne under a triumphal arch\".In 1750 Giambattista Tiepolo was called by Prince Bishop Karl Philipp von Greiffenklau to decorate the dining room and main staircase of the Residenz in Würzburg, designed by the architect Johann Balthasar Neumann and completed in 1744. In the dining room—now known as the Kaisersaal—Tiepolo painted three scenes with episodes from the life of Emperor Frederick I (ca. 1123–1190) known as Barbarossa. On the ceiling the artist representedApollo Conducting Beatrice of Burgundy to Frederick I, on the south side of the room theWedding of Frederick I to Beatrice of Burgundy, and on the north side theInvestiture of Bishop Harold(see fig. 1 above). The last two scenes were painted on triangular spaces in the coving of the ceiling, framed by pre-existing stuccowork curtains. The Met's painting is a sketch ormodellorelating to theInvestiturescene. Harold of Hochheim, Bishop of Würzburg, was invested as Duke of Franconia by Frederick I in 1168 and this would have been an important historical event to commemorate for his successor Prince Bishop von Greiffenklau. The final fresco was signed and dated by Tiepolo in 1752.A sketch for the central part of the ceiling survives in the Staatsgalerie, Stuttgart, and another for theWeddingscene—and most likely a companion to The Met's canvas—is in the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, Boston. A further version of theWeddingis in the National Gallery, London, and is probably a laterricordoby Tiepolo’s son, Giovanni Domenico.In the sketch Frederick Barbarossa is enthroned between the sculptures of Hercules and Minerva, under an elaborateall’anticaloggia. The architectural elements are particularly indebted to Venetian sixteenth-century models, Paolo Veronese above all. Bishop Harold kneels in front of the emperor, surrounded by courtly figures dressed in seventeenth-century and fantastic outfits. In the final fresco the scene was expanded from a vertical to a horizontal format. The architecture was visibly reduced and Bishop Harold was given the face of Prince Bishop von Greiffenklau. It has been argued that Tiepolo’s use of a vertical format suggests his ignorance of the precise location of the frescoes and that, therefore, the sketches could have been painted in Italy before the artist moved to Würzburg.Xavier F.

It represents an event in the city’s history that helped to celebrate and legitimize the region’s rulers: in 1168, Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa gave Harold of Hochheim, Bishop of Würzburg, the title of Duke of Franconia.",

        "Artist:": "Edwaert Collier (Dutch, Breda ca. 1640?–after 1707 London or Leiden)",
        "Date:": "1662",
        "Medium:": "Oil on wood",

        "Object Number:": "71.19",
        "Catalogue Entry": "Collier put his initials in two places on this early work: \"EC\" in monogram, above the date 1662 on the almanac (where the quill pen could suggest the freshness of the inscription); and \"E · K\" on the gold ring (Kollier was a common alternative spelling, often used by the artist himself). The painting is a fairly conventional, but well-conceived and well-composed, vanitas picture. The focus of the design in the area of the tipped-over silver tazza and green-glassroemer(which with the watch recall still lifes by Willem Claesz Heda) and the organization overall, with various X-patterns countering the impression of disarray, indicate that in his early twenties Collier had already mastered the syntax of a visual language in which earlier masters, including Pieter Claesz and Jan de Heem, had expressed themselves. The actual execution is another matter: Collier has a dry, rather petty touch, which he overcomes somewhat in the elaborate decorations of the tazza and other reflective surfaces. Even allowing for condition problems, however, the pearls (on a red ribbon), the moneybag, the oil lamp (with a faintly smoking wick), and the books look nearly as wooden as the violin and the shawm. Later works cannot be described as great advances beyond this point.Heda also comes to mind in connection with the fancy glass pitcher in the left background, and with the \"monochrome\" tonality throughout. Except for isolated patches of local color, the palette is quite restrained, perhaps in deference to the sober tenor of the subject. Some loss of color is the result of age, but the hints of burgundy in the table cover and the red in the flag were always subordinate to browns.The flag must refer to military or, more specifically, civic guard service, and is thus a sign of worldly honor (compare Rembrandt'sThe Standard Bearer (Floris Soop)in The Met's collection,49.7.35). In general, the objects refer to wealth and individual accomplishment, with (as often in Leiden still lifes) the vanity of learning given particular emphasis. Literature, secular music (unidentified), and hobbies such as astronomy (indicated by the crude version of a Blaeu celestial globe) will all pass away like whiffs of smoke, days marked by an almanac, hours ticked off by a watch, a tune played on the shawm, and measures of music. A string on the violin has conspicuously snapped. In this familiar context one hardly needs the skull, the hourglass, and the inscription in the center, \"VANITAS.\"Collier often included books and prints in his vanitas pictures. In some cases they represent mundane diversions, but usually the books and the person portrayed in a print are meant for the viewer's edification. The portrait print of the popular writer Jacob Cats (1577-1660) in The Met's painting was engraved by Michael Natalis after Pieter Dubordieu, and was published inAlle de wercken van Jacob Cats(1655). Collier raised and enlarged the first line of the inscription, which is below the image in the actual print, and set it off on a plaque. Cats had recently died, and he serves here as an exemplary figure, remembered for public service and moral advice. The large book is one volume of a Dutch edition ofThe Decades, or Fifty Sermons Divided into Five Decades, by the Swiss reformer Johann Heinrich Bullinger (1504–1575). Each \"decade\" consists of ten sermons. The third decade opens with sermons on material possessions, wealth, theft, and so on.The earliest known dated painting by Collier is evidently a less ambitious vanitas still life of 1661 (sold by the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco at Christie's, New York, June 15, 1985, no. 33), in which some similar motifs are found. Several still lifes by Collier are dated 1662, including a canvas in the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam; a canvas on the art market in 1999; and another sold in 2001. Comparable pictures date from the succeeding years.[2016; adapted from Liedtke 2007]",

Nuzi worked in Florence in 1346 and his work is related to that of Bernardo Daddi and to a pupil/assistant of Daddi’s, Puccio di Simone (the so-called Master of the Fabriano Altarpiece, as he was christened by Richard Offner; Puccio is the author of aSaint Anthony with Donorsin the Pinacoteca, Fabriano, dated 1353, as well as an altarpiece in the Accademia, Florence, that is signed \"Puccius Simonis\"). An engaging narrator and the author of devotional images notable for their combination of decorative richness and hieratic, austere compositions, Allegretto worked in fresco as well as tempera and seems also to have painted wood sculpture. Ghissi was his most important assistant and closely imitated his master’s style, though in a vein more notable for its charm than depth of feeling. The altarpiece to which The Met panels belonged would seem to be an early work, of about 1370, and possibly based on designs by Nuzi—whence the felicitous compositions.There is now no question concerning the reconstruction of the altarpiece, which had the rectangular format of a dossal, which had been common in the thirteenth century but less so in the fourteenth (see fig. 1 above). At the center was aCrucifixion(Art Institute of Chicago) with, at the foot of the cross, a woman dressed in black widow’s garb. To either side were four scenes arranged in two tiers showing miracles from the life of Saint John the Evangelist as recounted in the Golden Legend. The scenes in the top row are arched, those on the bottom rectangular. The spandrels are decorated with figures of seraphim (at the extremities) and four saints: a young martyr holding a palm, Saint John the Evangelist in a cauldron of boiling oil, Saint Francis, and Saint Louis of Toulouse. The narrative sequence began with the four scenes on the left, running from upper left to lower right, and finished on the right hand side, beginning in the upper left. The opening scene is in the Portland Art Museum; three are in the North Carolina Museum of Art, Raleigh; three in The Met; and the concluding panel is lost.The three scenes in The Met recount consecutive episodes. In the first (69.280.1) Saint John raises the young man Satheus to life. Satheus had been married only a short while when he died. His catafalque is accompanied by the young man’s mother and widow, who implore John’s intervention. Raised to life, Satheus then tells two former converts—Acteus and Eugenius—of the riches they forfeited in heaven through their backsliding; they implore forgiveness from the saint. (69.280.2). The third scene shows Saint John destroying the temple and statue of Diana through prayer (69.280.3), a deed that led to yet another trial: surviving a poisoned drink—the subject of a scene in North Carolina. In the event that Saint John’s martyrdom in a cauldron of boiling oil is shown in a spandrel, the last scene probably showed Saint John raising to life the two men who had been forced to drink the poison before him. This unusual emphasis on resurrection miracles was doubtless at the direction of the widow shown praying at the foot of the cross and must have had a very specific significance for her.In 1992, Zampetti suggested that the panels may have belonged to an altarpiece seen by Giovanni Cavalcaselle (Crowe and Cavalcaselle 1900) in the sacristy of the church of San Niccolò in Fabriano. Like the altarpiece to which The Met panels belonged, that work had at its center a Crucifixion. However, given the presence of Saints Francis and Louis of Toulouse in the spandrels, it is also possible that Ghissi’s altarpiece was for a Franciscan establishment.Keith Christiansen 2012",

        "Intro Description": "These three charming scenes belong to an altarpiece painted about 1370, probably for a church in the artist’s native Fabriano, in the region of the Marches. They illustrate the life of Saint John the Evangelist and follow the thirteenth-centuryGolden Legend. Saint John raises a young man, Satheus, from the dead; Satheus rebukes two former disciples for their interest in worldly goods, whereupon they return to Saint John and beg forgiveness; Saint John prays for the destruction of the Temple of Diana. Together with five other scenes, they were arranged in two tiers to either side of a Crucifixion.For more information about these paintings, including a reconstruction of the altarpiece, visit metmuseum.org.",

        "Intro Description": "The canvases that Gauguin sent back to France from the South Seas reflect the license he exercised in fashioning images of Indigenous women. Here, he channeled classicizing nudes, while relying on gesture and facial expression to evoke the ideal \"Tahitian Eve\" conjured in his writings: \"very subtle, very knowing in her naïveté\" and enviably \"capable of walking around naked without shame.\" Whispering confidences, offering exotic blossoms or (forbidden) fruit, the women inhabit a tropical Eden of Gauguin’s invention, in which his artistic vision—and male gaze—hold sway. These two figures also appear in his monumental worksFaa Iheihe (Tahitian Pastoral), 1898; (Tate, London) andRupe Rupe (The Fruit Harvest), 1899; (Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts, Moscow).",

        "Catalogue Entry": "Lady Mary Berkeley was the oldest of three daughters of Charles Berkeley, second Earl of Berkeley, and Elizabeth, daughter of Baptist Noel, third Viscount Campden. This portrait was probably painted soon after Lady Mary's marriage to Thomas Chambers, whose father, Sir Thomas, had purchased the manor and park of Hanworth, Middlesex, in 1670. The house, which burned in 1797, was said to have a room with a ceiling by Kneller. A portrait by Kneller of Lady Mary’s brother, James Berkeley, third Earl of Berkeley, belongs to the National Portrait Gallery, London. Lady Mary and her husband had two daughters and co-heirs, one of whom, Mary, married Lord Vere Beauclerk, third son of the first Duke of St. Albans, of whom the Museum owns a portrait by Kneller (39.65.8).This half-length portrait of Lady Mary in a feigned oval surround is unfinished. There is no evidence to suggest whether or not it was delivered. The attribution to Kneller has been accepted by Oliver Millar (1964) and J. Douglas Stewart (1990), and while W. G. Constable (1931) rejected it, it seems to fall within the canon, insofar as this has been established. The last part of the inscription on the picture was read prior to cleaning in 1948 as “G. Kneller Esquire fecit 1700.” There are other inscriptions of comparable wording, and the date accords well with the style.An area of damage extending from the sitter's hairline through her right eye to the bodice of her dress was caused by exposure to excessive heat and takes the form of a large number of tiny pinpoint losses and blisters.[2010; adapted from Baetjer 2009]",

        "Notes": "The picture is in a very good state of preservation.A portrait attributed to Corneille in the Musée des Beaux-Arts, Dijon, clearly represents the same individual. Oval in format and almost twice as large, it differs only in the sitter's glance, which is directed to the left. The Dijon version, which is stiffer and less spontaneous in effect, appears to have been made after the present picture. Its subject is presumed, on the basis of a supposed similarity to a portrait by Corneille in the Louvre, to be Jean de Bourbon-Vendôme (1528–1577), comte de Soissons et d'Eghien. A label in an eighteenth-century hand on the reverse of the Louvre panel designates the subject as Jean, a fairly sure identification. However, the features of the man in the Dijon and Linksy portraits do not agree sufficiently with those of the Louvre subject to extend the identification convincingly.",

        "Object Number:": "25.110.52",
        "Catalogue Entry": "The Painting:This composition is comprised of three horizontal bands: empty foreground, screen of trees, and sky. A closer look reveals a narrow strip of space beneath the tree canopy animated by nimble details such as the complementary curves of the path and river and the straight line of animals and human figures that begins with the cow on the left and leads the eye across the river to its far bank. These commonplace motifs may have been inspired by expanses of flat, pastoral scenery Rousseau saw in the forest of Fontainebleau, where, from 1836, he increasingly spent extended periods of time. This scenery also could have been inspired by Berry, which he visited at the suggestions of Jules Dupré in 1842, or the Landes, which he and Dupré visited together in 1844. Yet, the motifs were also pictorial devices, ones whose arrangement here and in other works is indebted to seventeenth-century Dutch landscape painting. This is true as well of the deployment of light as a unifying element.Virtually nothing is known about the origins ofA River in a Meadow—not when it was painted, the landscape that inspired it, or its first owner. It is a variation on a theme, one expressed to different effect in innumerable similar paintings, for example,The Pool (Memory of the Forest of Chambord)of 1839 (The Met1975.1.204) andThe Pond (La Mare)of 1855 (The Met1975.1.205). In spite of what these works hold in common, they are not formulaic. Rather, they reveal the artist’s capacity for investigating nature, apprehending its variety, and recalling it afterward as he set about producing a picture. This is the quality that his friend, the writer Théophile Silvestre, highlighted in his obituary of the artist, when he wrote: “The globe of his eye is striking in its breadth and capacity, filling itself almost voraciously with light, intelligence, and space.”[1]Despite the insistence on a human presence, the slow workings of nature take precedence over human drama in Rousseau’s paintings. In representing them, the artist sought to instill commensurate patience in the viewer, most immediately by enlivening the picture surface through his facture. This is most obvious in the foreground ofA River in a Meadow, where recognizable forms dissolve into open patches of paint scumbled over an initial layer of brown tone.[2] As the eye is drawn into the picture, it slowly becomes evident that human figures, animals, grasses, foliage—all the things that make up the picture—are rendered sketchily. Overall, low impasto is accentuated by the artist’s use of panel, a support favored by the Dutch masters and used frequently for cabinet pictures intended for private collectors.[3] Together, these factors are emblematic of the years between 1836 and 1849 when Rousseau’s paintings were either rejected by the Salon jury or withheld in protest, a challenging period during which he came to be known as \"Le Grand Refusé,\" forcing him to rely on dealers and private collectors for income.A River in a Meadowis one of many paintings by Rousseau that cannot be traced earlier than the decade after his death in 1867. It was first recorded in 1871, four years after the artist’s death, as being in the possession of a Monsieur Delondres, Paris (see Provenance). One piece of evidence, however, places it in Paris during the artist’s lifetime: the cradle on the back of the panel bears the stamps of the supplier Hostellet; their address is given as rue de la Tour d’Auvergne, Paris, making it likely that the painting was cradled between about 1856 and 1866.[4] In this context it is notable that from 1859 onward, there arose in the marketplace a demonstrable preference for Rousseau’s works of the 1840s over those in his latest style.[5]Appreciation of Dutch and British Landscape Painting in France:In Rousseau’s day, French artists could go to the Musée du Louvre in Paris to study Dutch paintings.[6] But they were not alone in appreciating them. A generation of British landscape artists preceded them, appraising their own countryside through the lens of Dutch painting. John Constable is cited most frequently in this context because of the sensation aroused by his display ofThe Haywain(1821, National Gallery, London) at the Paris Salon of 1824. Richard Parkes Bonington, who was closer in age to Rousseau, was English but active in France. There, he was crucial to the dissemination of Dutch and English naturalism and appreciated for his virtuosic sketchlike handling of paint, exemplified in works such asRoadside Halt(The Met45.146.1). The pervasiveness of this trend—and its sustained appeal across several decades—can be gauged by comparingA River in a Meadowwith John Crome’sHautbois Common, Norfolk(The Met89.15.14), as they both derive from pictures like Meyndert Hobbema’sEntrance to a Village(The Met14.40.614).Asher Miller 2020[1] This is a paraphrase, owing to the impossibility of translating Silvestre’s artful prose directly into English. Here is the original French: “Le globe de ses yeux, qui s’emplissaient avec une sorte de voracité d’intelligence lumière et d'espace, est d’une ampleur et d’un volume saisissants.” Excerpt from “Funerailles de Th. Rousseau à Barbison [sic],”Le Figaro, December 26, 1867, p. 3.[2] The ground was applied unevenly in broad strokes visible through the thinner overlying paint layers, its pebbled texture possibly resulting from the presence of metal soaps, though this has not been investigated. That the ground is white is apparent where some of the thinner overlying passages of paint appear to have been subject to abrasion in the past.[3] See Scott Allan, “‘A Method Matters Little’: Rousseau’s Working Procedures as a Painter,” in Scott Allan and Edouard Kopp,Unruly Nature: The Landscapes of Théodore Rousseau, exh. cat., J. Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles, 2016, p. 32.[4] Hostellet was located at 37 rue de la Tour d’Auvergne until 1856; from 1857 it was at number 48. Pascal Labreuche, email to Asher Miller, March 24, 2020, Department of European Paintings files.[5] In 1860, for example, the dealer Francis Petit presented a display of ten works by Rousseau that amounted to his first retrospective, but the artist lamented that it centered on works from the 1840s (Tableaux Tirés de Collections d’Amateurs et Exposés au Profit de la Caisse de Secours des Artistes, Peintres, Sculpteurs, Architectes et Dessinateurs, [Galerie Martinet], 26, boulevard des Italiens, Paris, 1860).

Zimmerman, eds.,Barbizon: Malerei der Natur—Natur der Malerei(Munich, 1999), pp. 425–26, 434 n. 57.[6] As recounted by his early biographers, Rousseau began copying in the Louvre in 1827, a practice that probably continued until at least 1831. See Philippe Burty, “Les Études peintes de Th. Rousseau,” inMaîtres et Petits Maîtres(Paris, 1877), pp. 73–74 (initially published asNotice des Etudes Peintes par M.

        "Notes": "Feilchenfeldt 2013 identifies no. 277, Iris, on the Bonger list (a catalogue of Van Gogh’s estate drawn up by Andries Bonger in late 1890) with this picture. However, another possibility is F601 (National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa). It may be that The Met’sIrisesdoes not appear on the list, as is the case with the Museum’sRoses(1993.400.5), which shares the same early provenance. On the Bonger list (now in the Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam, b 3055 V/1962) see Stolwijk and Veenenbos 2002, pp. 23–24.The “Bouquet d’Iris” exhibited at the \"Huitième exposition annuelle des XX\" in Brussels in February 1891 (as no. 4) was presumably the verticalIrisesnow in the Van Gogh Museum (F678), given the request made by Andries Bonger to pair it with an upright portrait, within a selection of works comprising pairs by format (the others were square and horizontal formats). Bonger wrote, \"Si possible, nous aimerions beaucoup que le portrait et le bouquet d’iris soient placés l’un à côté de l’autre.\" Andries Bonger, Letter to Octave Maus. December 22, 1890 (Archives de l'Art contemporain en Belgique, Brussels, inv. no. 5755).On August 22, 1902, Van Gogh’s mother, Anna van Gogh-Carbentus, wrote a letter in which she identified a painting of Irises (\"Irissen\") belonging to her estate and stipulated “it is my wish that the Irises will become Wil’s property” (Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam, inv. no. b2218 V/1982). This is probably a reference to The Met’s picture, or possibly F601 (National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa)—although the plural “Irissen” would seem not to apply to that single “Iris.” Willemien van Gogh, Vincent's sister, was institutionalized for life at the end of 1902.Apropos of Paris 1907, Félix Fénéon, the director of exhibitions for Bernheim-Jeune, wrote to Johanna van Gogh-Bonger on October 30, 1907, expressing interest in this work and The Met 1993.400.5 and adding that they would appear in the gallery’s November exhibition of still lifes. He wrote again on November 1, 1907, noting the arrival of the pictures, a small repair to theIrises, and the asking price of 5000 francs each (Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam, inv. nos. b5756 V/1996 and b5757 V/1996).This picture was photographed by Eugène Druet (pl. 72, no. 24/30–438 [\"15\" added to end of number in white pen], ca. 1900–1910, collection Le fonds Druet-Vizzavona, Médiathèque de l’architecture et du patrimoine, Fort de Saint-Cyr, Montigny-le-Bretonneux, France), probably during Paris 1908. A letter from Fénéon to Johanna van Gogh-Bonger on February 11, 1908, confirms that Druet photographed all the works in the exhibition (Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam, inv. no. b5763 V/1996).",
        "Intro Description": "In May 1890, just before he checked himself out of the asylum at Saint-Rémy, Van Gogh painted four exuberant bouquets of spring flowers, the only still lifes of any ambition he had undertaken during his yearlong stay: two of irises, two of roses, in contrasting color schemes and formats. In the Museum’sIriseshe sought a “harmonious and soft” effect by placing the “violet” flowers against a “pink background,” which have since faded owing to his use of fugitive red pigments. Another work from this series,Roses(1993.400.5), hangs in the adjacent gallery. Both were owned by the artist’s mother until her death in 1907.",

        "Catalogue Entry": "Mengs was a gifted portraitist, and when, in 1744, he returned to the court of Dresden from Rome after four years of training, he had for a short time a successful practice in pastel portraiture, in which he was inspired by Rosalba Carriera (1673–1757), whose work was well represented there. Mengs's portraits in pastel, painted with close and honest attention to appearances, are blond in tone and smoothly modeled, the colored strokes disguised, rather as in a highly finished oil painting.By contrast, the present work, while studied from a model, was probably improved in accordance with what Mengs understood to be the classical standard. Pretty and androgynous, this allegorical figure of Pleasure lies midway between the Rococo and Neoclassicism. The forms are soft and pleasing. Mengs must have intended that the figure, in its anatomical perfection, should be reminiscent both of Raphael and of the antique.Pleasuremay have been conceived as belonging to a group of three, withTruth(Museum of Fine Arts, Houston), andInnocence(of which at present only copies are known). For these personifications the artist relied closely upon descriptions in theIconologiaof Cesare Ripa, whose book directs that Pleasure should be shown as a handsome smiling youth of sixteen with a garland of roses on his head, dressed in green, and much adorned. The work may date to the mid-1750s.Katharine Baetjer 2010",

        "Notes": "When in the Holbach collection in 1756,Pleasurehad as a pendant an oval pastel representingInnocence, whose present whereabouts are unknown. A black chalk copy ofInnocencein the British Museum (T-05-12) shows a young girl dressed in white with a garland on her head, and holding a lamb. A third oval pastel by Mengs, representingTruth, is in the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston (98.590); a copy is in the British Museum (T-05-13). The two same-sized copies entered the British Museum's collection in 1789. Mengs drew on Cesare Ripa's iconographical encyclopedia, theIconologia(1611 ed., especially p. 423), for descriptions of the allegorical subjects.The composition ofPleasuremay also have been influenced by a famous Roman relief fragment representing Antinous (Villa Albani, Rome). The marquis de Croismare, having seenPleasureandInnocence, requested that Mengs paint two more in a similar style (see Grimm 1756 and Pelzel 1979),Allegory of VanityandAllegory of Wisdom. These may have been completed by December 1755, were delivered in 1756, and are now presumed lost. The preparatory drawings for them are in the Staatliche Kunsthalle in Karlsruhe.",

        "Intro Description": "Mengs, born in Bohemia, was for the most part trained in Rome, where he settled in 1751 and lived for much of his life. His contemporaries knew him as a gifted practitioner and theorist of Neoclassicism. Among his most famous works is the Parnassus ceiling in Cardinal Albani’s villa in Rome, completed in 1761. During a stay in Dresden, about 1744, he saw pastels by the artist Rosalba Carriera and emulated them, developing a successful practice as a court portraitist. The present work was studied from a model and perfected in accordance with Mengs’s understanding of classical standards. The figure represents Pleasure and is based upon an iconographical type developed by Cesare Ripa. The coloring is varied, the modeling delicate and softly blended.",

        "Catalogue Entry": "This panel and a scene showing the Flagellation of Christ (The Met2001.216.2) come from a large dismantled retable probably made for the high altar of the former Collegiate Church (Kollegiatstift) of Sankt Maria und Sankt Georg, now the Neustädter Marienkirche, in Bielefeld. One of the key monuments of late medieval painting in Westphalia, completed in 1400, the altarpiece was a triptych with folding wings about 6.56 meters wide when fully opened and about 2.18 meters high, including its lost frame. In the open state, it displayed a large central image of the Virgin and Child enthroned in the company of saints, flanked by thirty smaller scenes ranging from God Warns Adam about the Tree of Knowledge, through the life of the Virgin Mary and the Passion of Christ, to the Last Judgment, all on gold ground. The small scenes were arranged in three rows of ten, with the subjects progressing chronologically across each row, skipping over the Virgin and Child at center, from the upper left to the lower right. The folding wings displayed nine scenes each; the rest of the small scenes belonged structurally to the central panel and were thus immobile. The Museum’sCrucifixionis from the far right of the bottom row of the left wing. The internal divisions of the altarpiece were achieved with applied red strips decorated with rosettes at their intersections. The lost exterior decoration of the wings was probably painted either with standing saints or nonfigural ornaments.The central panel of the Bielefeld Altarpiece with its enthroned Virgin and Child and twelve New Testament scenes remains in the Marienkirche in Bielefeld. After the retable was dismantled in the course of church renovations in 1840–41, the wings were cut along their horizontal divisions, creating six three-scene fragments. It was in that state that all but one of the fragments were described (Förster 1847) and then catalogued (Krüger 1848) in the collection of Carl Wilhelm August Krüger of Minden, who probably acquired them from the church about 1840. Subsequently, the wing fragments were further divided into the individual scenes now found at the Gemäldegalerie, Berlin; the Oetker Collection and Marienkirche in Bielefeld; The Metropolitan Museum, New York; and the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford.Concerning attribution, it has long been recognized that the Bielefeld Altarpiece is by the Master of the Berswordt Altarpiece, named after a retable of the Crucifixion now in the Marienkirche, Dortmund, which bears the coat of arms of the Berswordt family of that city. With a project as extensive as the Bielefeld Altarpiece, the involvement of assistants in most stages can be taken for granted. The current compromised condition of many of the altarpiece’s parts, including The MetFlagellation, for example, which has sustained much damage in the past, necessarily frustrates any effort, as attempted in some of the literature, to distinguish between the master’s contributions and those of the workshop, assuming that such distinctions were discernible at all in the original state.Documents of the commission are not known to have survived. The patronage of the church’s college of canons has been put forth as a possibility, with the canon Hermann Crusing (who died shortly after 1397) possibly being influential in the process. Thus far, however, Pfeiffer (2009) has made the most convincing case for patronage in the persons of Wilhelm of Jülich, Duke of Berg (ca. 1348–1408), and his wife Anna of Bavaria (1346–1415), to whose territory Bielefeld belonged as part of the county of Ravensberg, and whose ancestors founded the Marienkirche and were entombed in its choir.With its secure date of 1400, the Bielefeld Altarpiece has played a pivotal role in the recent reevaluation of the Master of the Berswordt Altarpiece. The consensus view at present dates the rest of the master’s oeuvre before 1400—including the Berswordt Altarpiece in Dortmund, for which a date of 1431 has been maintained at times—thus overturning the old notion of the anonymous master as artistically dependent on Conrad von Soest, the greatly important Westphalian painter whose earliest surviving work dates from 1403. This reconsideration increasingly posits the Master of the Berswordt Altarpiece as a significant figure in the reception of artistic ideas emerging from France and the southern Netherlands and in the stylistic development of art in Westphalia and nearby Cologne.[2014; adapted from Waterman in Ainsworth and Waterman 2013]",
        "Technical Notes": "The support of is composed of two oak boards that originated in western Germany; the wood grain is oriented vertically. The boards are joined by tongue and groove. On the reverse of the panel there is evidence of the lap joint that connected it to the adjacent panel on the right, of a dowel for connecting framing elements on the upper left, and of a recess along the left side, where an original hinge was located. The presence of that dowel and the recess confirms that the panel was located in the bottom right of the inner left wing of the altarpiece. There is an original layer of lead white on the panel’s reverse, which has been covered thickly with wax. Two modern, horizontal crossbars have been attached to the panel with screws. Dendrochronological analysis of the panel indicated an earliest possible fabrication date for the painting of 1342; however, analysis of the boards in other parts of the altarpiece provided a later terminus post quem—an earliest possible fabrication date of 1373—for the whole ensemble.Fabric was glued to the panel supports of bothThe Flagellation(2001.216.2) andThe Crucifixionand before the white ground preparation was applied. There is no apparent priming layer. In both paintings the ground was incised to indicate the areas to be gilded. In this panel, the position of Christ’s Cross is designated with ruled lines. The halos of the Virgin and Saint John are defined with incised lines and enhanced with punched decoration. In both panels the gilding that forms the backgrounds was applied directly to the ground. Ground gilding (calledLeimvergoldungin German) has been documented in North European paintings that date, for the most part, from the thirteenth century. The smoothed ground layer is coated with an aqueous adhesive such as animal glue, to which the gold leaf is applied and then burnished and tooled, as desired.The artist relied on a layering technique—with particular emphasis on scumbles—to achieve color effects and to create volume. The blended brushstrokes and creamy appearance of the paint suggest that the medium could be a \"fatty\" tempera, in which oil is mixed with an egg-yolk binder. The use of this medium has been reported in studies of other paintings from the same altarpiece.Overall the paintings are in fair condition; however, the surfaces are worn along the edges of an extensive crack pattern, and abrasion from harsh cleaning has increased the visibility of the original underlying fabric. The brown painted borders on both panels are not original. Examination with the stereomicroscope reveals fragments of an opaque red below the brown overpaint; this may perhaps be fragmentary evidence of the red and white patterned border present on other panels of the altarpiece.When the surfaces of the paintings are examined in normal light, some underdrawing in the form of cursory contours applied with a liquid medium is visible. Examination with infrared reflectography did not reveal any further underdrawing, although investigations of other panels attributed to the same artist have found underdrawing executed with brush, red chalk, and possibly metalpoint.[2013; adapted from German Paintings catalogue]",

Kornfeld 1933]; adds that no other benefactors are mentioned between the years 1389 and 1443.Alfred Menzel. \"Der Bielefelder Marienaltar: Beobachtungen zu seiner Theologie.\"Der Bielefelder Marienaltar: Das Retabel in der Neustädter Marienkirche.

        "Notes": "The Crucifixion and The Flagellation (2001.216.2) were among eighteen scenes that made up the interior wings of an altarpiece that was intact in the Neustädter Marienkirche, Bielefeld, until the church was restored about 1840. According to nineteenth-century sources, the original frame bore the date of 1400. The central panel, a Glorification of the Virgin flanked by twelve scenes, is still in the Bielefeld church. The eighteen scenes from the wings along with the twelve scenes of the main panel formed a sequence of the fall of man and the life of the Virgin and of Christ, concluding with the Last Judgment. They were arranged in three registers reading across the width of the open altarpiece from left to right, the altarpiece measuring altogether about 182 x 550 cm. The individual scenes were originally separated by stucco borders which were removed in restoration. The subject of the exterior wings is not known.Of the other scenes from the wings, God Warning Adam and Eve, Adoration of the Magi, Flight into Egypt, and Betryal of Christ are in the R. A. Oetker Museum, Bielefeld; the Presentation in the Temple is in the Gemäldegalerie, Berlin; Christ before Pilate is in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford; and Carrying of the Cross is in a private collection, London.Tracings of all but three of the scenes from the wings are preserved at the Westfälisches Denkmalamt, Münster.The Master of the Berswordt Altar is named after the altarpiece with scenes of the Passion in the Marienkirche, Dortmund, which bears the arms of the von Berswordt family on the frame.",
        "Intro Description": "Emotion conveyed through elegantly stylized figures is a traitThe Crucifixionshares with other works of the so-called courtly (or International) style that prevailed in Europe in the years around 1400. It is from an imposing altarpiece that included thirty narrative scenes around a central panel of the Madonna and Child. The main panel is still in the Neustädter Marienkirche in Bielefeld, Westphalia. The artist was one of the foremost painters in northwest Germany, and notably incorporated influences from French and Burgundian manuscripts.",

        "Catalogue Entry": "Montessuy was a student of Pierre Révoil, Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres, and Louis Hersent, in succession, but a slow convalescence from wounds suffered during the Revolution of 1830 temporarily sidelined his painterly ambitions. He finally struck out for Rome in April 1836, eventually discovering the hill town of Subiaco. What began in the 1780s as a slow trickle of French painters drawn there for its picturesque terrain grew steadily in the first decades of the nineteenth century, when artists discovered its frescoes and its people. The setting of this painting is the monastery of San Benedetto, which was constructed in the thirteenth century around the cave in which Benedict lived for three years about 500 A.D. The Sacro Speco, as the chapel installed in the living rock of the cave is known, is just behind the door through which the reigning pontiff, Gregory XVI, emerges into the richly decorated anteroom.If Montessuy made it to Subiaco by October 22, 1836, he could have seen the oil study depicting the same interior by the Dane Martinus Rørbye, who on that day showed it to fellow artists there; otherwise he may have seen it on one of the following days in Rome (the finished painting, dated 1843, is in the Statens Museum for Kunst, Copenhagen; Rørbye’s diary is in the Statens Museum’s library). It appears that in taking a recent historical event as a pretext for this picturesque costume piece—Gregory worshiped at San Benedetto on April 30, 1834, fully two years before Montessuy left for Italy—the artist relied on eyewitness accounts. According to Montessuy’s hagiographer Aimé Vingtrinier, the subject of this painting is represented factually (\"tout d’actualité\"); it was painted mostly in Subiaco and finished in Rome, where it made the artist’s reputation before being sent to France for exhibition (see Vingtrinier 1883).Gregory’s visit is described in detail in the monastery’s chronicle,Libro delle Memorie dal 1831 al 1850(housed in the library of its sister institution, Santa Scolastica): \". . . After a brief rest in the Abbot’s Apartment, where he picked up themozzetta[short cape] and the Pontifical stole, the H[oly] Father entered the Superior Church, whence, having venerated the Most Blessed Sacrament, he descended to the Sacred Cave to celebrate the Holy Mass, assisted by the R[eve]r[end] F[athers] Abbots Bini and Piacenti.\" It also describes the indelible impression the event made on area peasants: \"While the H[oly] Father ascended the steep slopes, the Municipal Administrators of Jenne were expressing their jubilation with the continuous firing of mortars, and at the same time the village people, as well as others from nearby villages, men and women spread out around the tortuous turns of that road, paid him homage with their acclamations, giving him unequivocal demonstrations of their tender devotion, to which his Sanctity responded with the most endearing gestures of his benevolent nature, listening to the supplications of many, and permitting to all the kissing of the Foot.\" Some of his information may have been related to Montessuy by a certain Fra Vicenzo, who on April 21, 1837, told the painter Hippolyte Flandrin that he had posed for all the paintings François-Marius Granet had made at Subiaco many years before. (\"Journal d’Hippolyte Flandrin, janvier 1833–juillet 1838: Séjour en Italie,\" in Marthe Flandrin and Madeline Froidevaux-Flandrin,Les Frères Flandrin, trois jeunes peintres aux XIXe siècle, Olonne sur Mer, 1984, p. 102 [April 21, 1837]; he must have posed for Granet’s 1818 painting of this interior, now in the Musée de Dreux).This, Montessuy’s first masterpiece in a vein that he would pursue for the remainder of his career, was exhibited at the Paris Salon of 1844 and at the Société des Amis des Arts, Lyons, in 1844–45, where it was acquired by Lidie Pavy. It remained essentially unseen until it was acquired by the Museum in 2003. There is no more complete expression of the Lyonnais penchant for surface description than this picture.

        "Catalogue Entry": "This exquisite portrait of a youth is usually considered the sole survivor of Cosmè Tura's activity as a portrait painter at the Este court of Ferrara. The only other certain portrait by him is the kneeling figure of Cardinal Bartolomeo Roverella on a lateral panel of an altarpiece in the Colonna Collection, Rome. Additionally, Tura has been attributed with the design of three medals of Duke Ercole d'Este, the duchess Eleonora of Aragon, and their son Alfonso, as well as a portrait miniature of the duchess. Tura was employed at the Este court from 1451, but it is only in 1472 that we have a record of him painting portraits. The first was of Duke Ercole I and his illegitimate daughter Lucrezia d'Este; these were painted on canvas to facilitate their shipment to Naples as a gift for Ercole's future wife, Eleonora of Aragon. A pattern was established: in 1477, three portraits of the infant Alfonso d'Este, whose future claim to the duchy had been secured the previous year by the execution of his half-cousin, Niccolò, the son of Leonello d'Este; 1479, a portrait of Lucrezia d'Este to send to her promised husband, Annibale Bentivoglio; 1480, a portrait of the six-year-old Isabella d'Este on the occasion of her betrothal to Francesco Gonzaga; 1485, one of the ten-year-old Beatrice d'Este to her promised spouse Ludovico il Moro (Manca 2000, docs. 74, 96, 101–2, 107, 115). As is evident from this list, the commission of portraits was associated with dynastic ambition, alliances, and the commemoration of important events. Prices varied from three florins for each of the portraits of the infant Alfonso to four for the others (the price for the portraits on canvas is not indicated). Although the portraits are invariably described as taken from life, they are likely to have been bust-length, profile portraits much like the one in The Met: the sitter accommodated to an accepted formula. Examination of The Met's portrait with infrared reflectography reveals no underdrawing, and it seems likely that a detailed drawing—\"retratto dal naturale\"—was employed.The dates assigned to Tura's portrait range from the mid-1450s to, most recently and convincingly, the mid-1470s (see Syson 1999, and, for a review of the various opinions, Manca 2000). A date in the mid- to late 1470s would be in keeping with Tura's documented activity as court portraitist—a position practiced under Ercole's predecessor, Borso, by Baldassare d'Este. Certainly, the richly described hair, the cascading waves of which offer a perfect foil for the imperturbable expression and minimal modeling of the face, compares favorably with what is found in a Saint Christopher (Gemäldegalerie, Berlin) from an altarpiece that is usually dated no earlier than ca. 1470. As others have noted, the emphasis on a sharply defined profile and the shallow, delicately inflected modeling of the head compare well with the medal of Ercole designed by Tura ca. 1477–78. Although the identity of the sitter remains a matter of conjecture, his profile has features similar to those of Borso d'Este and he is likely a member of the Este family, though none of the identities thus far proposed is completely convincing. The youth wears a green doublet with lacing, or rather arming points, on the sleeves, a fringed tunic (giornea), and a red cap. Arming points were used to secure armor—the vambrace—to the arm, but by around 1450 they had become a fashion accessory independent of their original function (Capwell 2002, pp. 183–84). The sitter is blond and blue-eyed, and his coiffed hair is arranged so as to frame his face with a sharp diagonal, while stray locks on his forehead give visual emphasis to his proudly arched brow and heavy-lidded eye. Tura has made a virtue of the youth's physiognomic weaknesses or defects, such as the overbite, thereby transforming an unexceptional countenance into a perfect expression of nobility.The Met's painting has sometimes been thought a fragment from a larger composition. However, in 2010 it was carefully examined and x-rayed. It emerged that the vertical extensions right and left were made over the original panel and that remnants of the original painted edges of the portrait were distinguishable. The background had been overpainted in Prussian blue—a pigment not used in the fifteenth century. Removal of this pigment revealed the original azurite background as well as the panel to which an engaged frame had been attached. The intended format was therefore a very narrow picture field—much like that of Pisanello's portraits. Tura, working within this remarkably constricted format, was nonetheless able to create an indelible image of aristocratic aloofness.The picture reminds us why it was that the profile portrait remained the preferred form at Italian courts for so long and was only gradually replaced by the three-quarter view.Keith Christiansen 2011",

        "Intro Description": "This is the only surviving independent portrait by Tura, the imaginative court artist at Ferrara. It shows an unidentified member of the ruling Este family whose features resemble those of Tura’s patron Borso d’Este. The small, narrow format suggests the painting was designed to be portable, likely stored in a leather or parchment case when moved around. The profile view prevailed in Italy well into the fifteenth century, eventually replaced by the three-quarter view.

        "Catalogue Entry": "The Artist:For a biography of Bernard van Orley, see the Catalogue Entry forVirgin and Child with Angels(14.40.632).The Subject of the Painting:This panel andThe Martyrdom of Saint John the Baptist(Promised Gift of Hester Diamond; see fig. 1 above)–the left and right wings of a triptych—depict episodes from the life of Saint John the Baptist, namely the birth and naming of Saint John and his martyrdom. In the former, the story begins at the upper left corner where an angel appears to Zechariah, kneeling at an altar, to announce the birth of his son, to be named John (Luke 1:5–25). Because of his wife Elizabeth’s advanced age, Zechariah was incredulous at this news and as a result was rendered mute by the angel. Indeed Elizabeth, shown lying in her bed, did give birth to a son. Three women bathe the infant John in the foreground; among them is the Virgin Mary in a simple fur-lined blue dress. It is Mary who then presents the child to his father in the middle ground, where Zechariah reads the prophesy of the angel from a scroll, and dutifully names him John.The right wing relates the story of the martyrdom of Saint John the Baptist (Matthew 14:1–12; Mark 6:14–28; Luke 3:19–20 and 9:7–9). King Herod had married Herodias, the wife of his brother, Philip, thereby breaking the law for which John the Baptist openly rebuked him. Consequently, John was thrown into prison (at the far left), and Herodias began to campaign for the death of the preacher. She schemed with her daughter Salome, who danced for Herod at his birthday banquet in order to seduce him and exact from him her mother’s greatest desire: the head of John the Baptist on a platter. The scene of Salome dancing before her father in a wild frenzy takes place at the upper right, where the head of the saint is already on a platter, being stabbed by Herodias (as discussed in apocryphal fourth century accounts; see the Catalogue Entry for Aelbert Bouts,Head of Saint John the Baptist on a Platter,60.55.2). In the foreground the executioner places the severed head of the Baptist on a platter held by one of two reticent female courtiers. Two musicians from the banquet gawk at the horrific event. In the far left background, the bones of John the Baptist are burned by pagans in order to stop the miracles taking place at the Baptist’s gravesite (according to Jacobus de Voragine’sGolden Legend).[1] Balancing the two wings at far left and right are, respectively, a live peacock and a bronze statue of a lion.The Patron and Commission:On the reverse of the two paintings, superimposed on faux marble backgrounds, were painted a banderole with the mottoFINIS CORONAT, passing behind a crozier, and a trompe-l’oeil painting of the Man of Sorrows (at left), and a portrait of a cleric facing left with hands clasped in prayer (formerly at right; fig. 2). The subsequently detached portrait was apparently preserved and sold independently by Parke-Bernet Galleries at an auction in January 1947, where it was listed as a portrait of \"S. Bernard of Clairvaux by Bernart van Orley\" (whereabouts unknown; fig. 3).[2]  A veiled crozier is the sign of office of an abbot and distinguishes an abbot’s crozier from that of a bishop. The veil attached to the node of the crozier’s stem allowed the abbot to touch the crozier through the veil, as only a bishop was permitted to wear gloves. The link between the mottoFINIS CORONATand the abbot Jacques Coëne was made possible by the research of Jean Buzelin, who published the epitaph, citing the motto of Jacques Coëne in Douai in 1624–25 (Van Gelder 1973, pp. 170–72).[3]FINIS CORONATis a shortened version ofFinis coronat opus(the end crowns the work), a proverb that appears to have come into usage in the Middle Ages and thereafter was known in various versions.[4] The “end” presumably refers to death, and the “work” (implied here, but missing) to the life lived. Thus, Coëne would have aspired to a good death as the crowning achievement of a well-lived life, as in the tradition of theArs moriendi(The Art of Dying), a popular fifteenth-century manual that related how to “die well” according to Christian precepts.Originally from Bruges, Coëne served as abbot at the Benedictine abbey church of Marchiennes, France, from 1501 to 1542.[5] A well-known patron of the arts, Coëne early on commissioned several paintings from Bernard van Orley, includingChrist Among the Doctorsand theMarriage of the Virgin(ca. 1506, National Gallery of Art, Washington), which were once part of a polyptych.[6] Consecrated in the abbey church of Marchiennes in 1515 were two separate altarpieces. One comprises the Saint John panels discussed here, and the other is devoted to Saint Martin, representingThe Knighting of Saint Martin(Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art, Kansas City) andThe Adoration of the Virgin and Child by Saint Martin with Saints Peter, Paul, Agnes, and Thelka(private collection, The Netherlands; see Dunbar 2005, pp. 204–5, 207, 209). Following Max J. Friedländer (1937), Ludwig Baldass (1944) originally thought that the Saint John panels and the Saint Martin panels were part of the same altarpiece, the latter superimposing the former. However, as Van Gelder (1973) noted, they are mentioned separately in 1546 and 1555 inventories of the abbey church at Marchiennes (see Refs.) and were not installed in the same chapel. Furthermore, it would make little sense to encounter theFINIS CORONATmotto four times, as well as two portraits of Coëne, on the reverses of these two sets of panels when closed in triptych form.The closed reverses of the Saint John the Baptist panels would have shown the portrait of Jacques Coëne in prayer, facing the devotional image of the Man of Sorrows (fig. 2). As in the stylistically related wings with scenes from the life of Saint Martin, the central element of the Saint John the Baptist ensemble is missing. In terms of Saint John the Baptist’s life, the major and subsidiary scenes respectively unaccounted for here are the Baptism of Christ and Saint John Preaching in the Wilderness. For the altarpiece of Saint Martin it is Saint Martin dividing his cloak for the poor. The fact that the key episodes from both saints’s lives are missing is a coincidence, and it is equally likely that such scenes were sculpted as painted. There was a thriving production in the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries in Antwerp and Brussels of sculpted retables with painted wings, a collaboration to which Brussels painters Colyn de Coter and the Master of the View of Sainte-Gudule contributed, as well as possibly Bernard van Orley.[7] Just when the Saint John and Saint Martin wings were detached from their centerpieces is unknown. By 1817 the Marchiennes church had been demolished, but most of its paintings had long since been dispersed. A 1792 French Revolution confiscation inventory lists the five panels of a Jan van Scorel altarpiece of Saint Stephen, but these were the only ones on the list also commissioned by Jacques Coëne that were still remaining.[8] Triangular portions are present on the upper portions of both the Saint John and the Saint Martin panels (see Technical Notes and Dunbar 2005, p. 201), and it is likely that these were added to eliminate the curved portions of an ogee-arched panel in order to convert these into independent paintings—unrelated to a triptych—for sale. An example of how the triptych may have looked, before being dismembered and the wings cut down, is the Passion Retable of Averbode (fig. 4).The Attribution and Date:The Saint John the Baptist paintings are neither signed nor dated, and no documentary evidence confirms their attribution. However, just like The Met’sVirgin and Child with Angels(14.40.632), they can be related closely to the style of Bernard van Orley’s earliest signed work of about 1515–20, theScenes from the Legends of Saint Thomas and Saint Matthew (the Brussels Joiners’ and Coopers’ Altarpiece). Comparing The Met’sBirth and Naming of Saint John the Baptistto the inside left wing of the Saints Thomas and Matthew altarpiece (fig. 5), one can see an identical pictorial strategy in play. Van Orley established open architectural structures and porches parallel to and at angles to the picture plane, within which he grouped his figures in distinct episodes of an extended narrative. He described spatial recession by establishing a few key figures in the foreground whose draperies spill over in exaggerated folds into the viewer’s space, and then strategically placed additional figures behind columns, and further in subsidiary scenes in gradually smaller sizes in the distance. Van Orley’s favored palette at this early stage was primary colors of red, blue, and green. The earlier date of the Saint John panels in relationship to the Saints Thomas and Matthew paintings is clear from several salient features. There is a less sophisticated description of space, a more restrained sense of ornamentation and decoration, less distinctively individualized faces that appear here more naïve in expression, and figural poses and gestures that are not as graceful or boldly animated as in the later work. This suggestion of an earlier date is also supported by the differences in the underdrawing on the panels (figs. 6–9). The Saint John paintings are a far less ambitious commission than theScenes from the Legends of Saint Thomas and Saint Matthewand are considerably smaller in scale. Nonetheless, they also show a less refined sense of modeling of the figures and their draperies, and a more abbreviated, shorthand technique for indicating the features of the faces (see Technical Notes and Galand 2013, pp. 110–11 and fig. 79 with figs. 80–81). Abbey records show that the altars dedicated to Saints John the Baptist and Martin were consecrated in 1515. The altarpieces are thus likely to have been completed sometime between 1514 and 1515.Maryan W.

        "Technical Notes": "Support:The support was constructed from three boards, with the grain oriented vertically. The boards were originally held in place with two dowels per join, as evident in the x-radiograph (see fig. 10 above). The double-sided panel measures 1/4 inch (0.6 cm) thick, on average. The panel has not been analyzed with dendrochronology. Abarbeis present on left, bottom, and right, indicating that the original edges are preserved. The top edge was almost entirely cut, but about 1 3/16 inch of the curved original edge remains at the far right, which curves downward toward the right side, suggesting that the top was not originally a straight edge but an asymmetrical shape. At some point, the shaped top was cut to make the panel square and a very small triangular piece of wood, measuring 3/16 x 1 3/16 in. (0.5 x 3 cm), was inserted at upper right to square off the panel. Furthermore, the location of the dowels along the joins suggests that the left side would be taller: the dowels are more closely spaced on the left as if to allow for a third.The related panel,The Martyrdom of Saint John(Promised Gift of Hester Diamond, New York), has a nearly identical triangle of unpainted wood at upper left, suggesting that the two panels were similarly shaped and were mirror images of each other. When closed they would have followed the shape of a central panel. Physical evidence from the two panels belonging to the Saint Martin altarpiece—close in dimensions, and commissioned for the same church (see Catalogue Entry)—sheds further light on the original shapes of the Saint John panels.The Knighting of Saint Martin by the Emperor Constantinepanel (Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art, Kansas City) and theSaint Martin Adoring the Virgin and Child with Saintspanel (private collection, The Netherlands) also have triangular inserts, in the upper right of the former and upper left of the latter, suggesting that the Saint Martin panels originally had similarly shaped tops.The Saint Martin panels, though nearly identical in widths to the Saint John panels and having a very similar placement of compositional elements on front and back, are taller, measuring 29 15/16 x 27 3/8 in. (75.9 x 69.5 cm; Kansas City) and 29 1/8 x 26 3/4 in. (74 x 68 cm; private collection, The Netherlands).[1] The triangular inserts are also larger, (Kansas City measures 4.4 x 29.8 cm; the private collection panel is reportedly similar).[2] Taken together measurements suggest that all four panels were originally the same sizes, but that the Saint John panels have been cut to a greater degree, around 1 1/2 inches (4 cm), at the top.Preparation:The panel was prepared with a white ground. Examination with infrared reflectography revealed the presence of an extensive underdrawing executed with a liquid medium (figs. 6–9).[3] The loose underdrawing set out the figures with spare but expressive lines. The artist drew the eyes with simple circles and created the faces with only a few strokes, which manage to suggest both individualized features and emotion. The Virgin, shown in profile as she presents the infant to Zechariah, is a good example of his minimal yet dramatic drawing, as in the curve of her brow and the set of her mouth. The occasional flourish, in keeping with Van Orley’s expressive style of underdrawing, is smoothed out in the final painting. The artist also added some shading to the underdrawing, mainly straight parallel lines with a few curving hatchmarks, such as in the bodice of the splendidly dressed attendant to the left of the infant John. The reflectogram also revealed minor changes; shifts to contours and the simplification of decoration, for example, in the pillar at upper left.Paint Layers:The handling of the rather thick and occasionally impasted paint throughout the composition is impressively fluid. The reclining figure of Elizabeth is the most notable example of this approach, with the paint quite built up in both face and her white dress. The artist created highlights by adding zones of fine white brushstrokes, which blend together at a normal viewing distance. These dramatic white highlights accentuate the planes of the face in a masklike way, reminiscent of the technique of The Met’sVirgin and Child with Angelsof ca. 1518 (14.40.632). Van Orley also added white strokes as final highlights to the often rather tubular fingers.The technique of the reverse is difficult to judge due to its compromised state: it has suffered much damage, not surprising for the more vulnerable outer wing of a folding altarpiece. The fleshtones of Christ are quite rubbed, but the buildup of paint in the x-radiograph (fig. 10) gives a sense of the original modeling. The upper left of the reverse is particularly rubbed. By contrast, the obverse remains in very good condition; losses are restricted to the joins, with minimal retouching.The attendant’s dress, which is now a very pale blue, has traces of a red lake that would have originally rendered the robe violet, a more pleasing contrast with the Virgin’s blue robe. Passages of green have discolored to brown as is characteristic of copper-containing glazes, for example, in the robes and the peacock’s feathers.Sophie Scully 2018[1] Dunbar 2005, p. 207.[2] Dunbar 2005, p. 201.[3] Infrared reflectography completed with a Merlin Indigo InGaAs near-infrared camera with a StingRay macro lens customized for the wavelengths covered by the camera, 0.9 to 1.7 microns, September 2011.",

Linas 1856]; supports Linas's view that the three altars consecrated in 1515 and reconsecrated on March 27 and 28, 1541, including the altar for John the Baptist, were probably damaged during construction of the choir; notes that the description of the Saint John altar at the time of its rededication [see Ref.

It depicts Saint Elizabeth in bed, shortly after giving birth. Zacharias appears at the entrance to her room, carrying a scroll that declares his son’s name will be John.

        "Loan Restrictions": "This work may not be lent, by terms of its acquisition by The Metropolitan Museum of Art.",
        "Intro Description": "Critical opinions of this picture have varied considerably since about 1905, when Wilhelm von Bode described it as \"a somewhat abnormal work\" by Rembrandt. However, most scholars since the 1940s have dated the painting to the 1660s and assigned it to an anonymous pupil. The composition is reminiscent of mature works by Rembrandt but the Rembrandtesque surface effects fail to convey anything like the master's command of illumination and modelling. The name of his only known pupil of the 1660s, Arent de Gelder, has been put forward speculatively.",

(color), identifies it as a view of meadows and distant mountains of the Elbsandsteingebirge, south of Dresden; comments that the artist's \"close observation and truthfulness...turn this modest-seeming image into something poetic and magical, reminiscent of Dürer's nature studies\".",
        "Notes": "A similar composition by Heinrich (oil on canvas mounted to cardboard, 21 x 26 cm) is in the Galerie Neue Meister, Staatliche Kunstsammlungen, Dresden.",
        "Intro Description": "This view opens toward meadows and the distant Elbsandsteingebirge, sandstone mountains that rise to the southeast of Dresden. Heinrich approached landscape with sober objectivity, which sets his work apart from the emotional response to nature championed by his colleagues Caspar David Friedrich and Johan Christian Dahl. This is one of only five known paintings by Heinrich; a related study is in the Museum Georg Schäfer, Schweinfurt.",
