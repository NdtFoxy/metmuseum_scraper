        "Title:": "Salisbury Cathedral from the Bishop's Grounds",

        "Object Number:": "50.145.8",
        "Catalogue Entry": "Salisbury Cathedral with its stone spire, the tallest in England, dates to the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries and is surrounded by a flat landscape of water meadows. Constable visited Salisbury in September 1811 at the invitation of Dr. John Fisher, bishop of Salisbury; in early October 1816 on his wedding trip; and in the summer of 1820 to stay with the bishop's nephew Archdeacon John Fisher and his wife. A drawing of the cathedral from the southwest (Victoria and Albert Museum, London; 292-1888) is dated 1811 and contains the germ of the present composition. A related drawing (private collection) is dated 1820. Both depict the chapter house and the south and southeast transepts, with the east end hidden behind an evergreen and other trees. There must have been many more sketches of the kind than now survive.If not commissioned by the bishop, Constable's first finished painting titledSalisbury Cathedral from the Bishop’s Grounds, now in the Victoria and Albert Museum, was eventually intended for him and in 1823 was exhibited at the Royal Academy. The artist may have been referring to an oil study (National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa) for the London picture when he wrote on September 1, 1820, to the younger Fisher, reporting that his Salisbury sketches, including the one made in the cathedral grounds, had been \"much liked.\" In November, the bishop opined that he would like to see the sketch finished, \"to grace my Drawing Room in London.\" Instead, Constable painted the new and larger canvas referred to above, showing, at the left, the bishop, with his wife on his arm, pointing toward the cathedral with his walking stick.The bishop expressed his dislike of the dark cloud directly over the spire, wanting a sunnier sky. Meanwhile, Constable painted a smaller, squared oil sketch (private collection) and then a smaller finished painting of the cathedral (Huntington Library, Art Collections, and Botanical Gardens, San Marino, California) as a wedding present from the elder Fisher to his daughter, Elizabeth, which was finished in time for her marriage on October 16, 1823. The following year, Constable engaged a Suffolk boy, John Dunthorne Jr., to join him as an assistant in his London studio. The artist sent for the cathedral picture, presumably to use it as a model for another work, noting in a letter to his wife of July 12 that \"Johnny has done a delightfull outline of my Cathedral same size for me to copy.\"The present canvas is the full-scale study for Constable’s sixth and final painting (Frick Collection, New York) of the great Gothic building from the grounds to the southwest, which, although intended finally to fulfill his commission from the bishop, was never received by him; it is fully signed and dated 1826, but Fisher had died in May of the previous year. Both of the paintings in New York show the spire of Salisbury Cathedral rising into a bright sky, its height and shape emphasized by white clouds and flanked by the slanting trunks and branches of the old trees to either side in the foreground. While the present canvas was on Constable’s easel, he made changes in the design, suppressing foliage that met in an arc over the top of the spire, the existence of which is documented by infrared reflectography.A secure chronology for the six paintings of Salisbury Cathedral from the southwest has been developed in recent years, and it has been assumed that Dunthorne prepared his \"delightfull outline\" on the present canvas. In fact, on the evidence of recent infrared reflectography, the apparent differences in preparation and handling between The Met and Frick pictures are minimal. Constable may have asked Dunthorne to transfer the design of the cathedral to both canvases, but it cannot be said at present whether any of the drawing visible in the infrared images is, or is not, his.What can be said is that in the underlying drawing for The Met’s picture, the trees still meet above the spire, as in the canvas in the Victoria and Albert Museum. The composition seems to have been opened up by Constable in the later stages of painting the sketch, so that there is blue sky not only above but also among the branches of the trees to the right. The underdrawing of the Frick picture, which follows The Met’s painted sketch, is slightly more elaborate, while the two compositions are on the same scale and perfectly aligned. Constable must have completed them in succession, between late July 1824, the date after which he began The Met's picture, and November 1825, when he described the one in the Frick Collection as \"nearly compleated.\"The three finished paintings of the cathedral and The Met's sketch contain abundant and accurate architectural detail, such as the bishop, a person of eighteenth-century taste and sensibility, would doubtless have required. In all, the chapter house, an octagon, reads as square, perhaps in the interest of legibility. It may be imagined that Constable would have been glad of an assistant, Dunthorne, to prepare an outline of some sort before he took up his fifth and sixth canvases of the subject.[2012; adapted from Baetjer 2009]",

        "Intro Description": "This painting was made as a full-scale study for the picture of 1826 now in the Frick Collection, New York. The latter picture was completed for Constable’s friend John Fisher, bishop of Salisbury, who appears at lower left in both canvases. In fact the commission dates back to 1822; in the course of working on the composition, Constable opened up the tree canopy and added a sunny sky to frame the cathedral’s medieval spire, the tallest in England.",

Their father, John, third Duke of Dorset, commissioned the picture, which was painted in July 1796 at Knole, the family seat in Kent; the duke paid Hoppner 105 pounds for it. The duchess had sat to Hoppner the year before (Sackville Collection, Knole), while the artist would paint George, by then the fourth duke, again several years later (location unknown). Finally married at forty-five, the third duke had three children and died when his son was five. He had earlier enjoyed considerable notoriety and the company of many mistresses, the Countess of Derby (The Met49.7.57) and Nancy Parsons (The Met45.59.3) among them. The fourth Duke was killed in a fall from his horse at age twenty-one. The picture passed from his elder sister to his younger.Vita Sackville-West, in her history of Knole (1949), recounted a story told her by her grandfather: \"[He] used to show me the baby girl, telling me that while Hoppner was seeking for a pose for his picture a grievance arose between the two little girls because one had shoes and the other had not, and that on Lord Middlesex taking his sister into his arms for consolation, Hoppner rushed at them exclaiming that he could not improve upon the charm of this accidental pose. I think this story has a convincing ring about it. Certainly it was the only anecdote which my grandfather had to tell of any picture in the house; usually he did not know a Hoppner from a Vandyck, a Kneller from a Gainsborough. He said that he had the story straight from his mother, Lady Elizabeth, the sulky baby of Hoppner’s picture.\"The boy’s pose is based on Reynolds's portrait of John Crewe, titledPortrait of a Boy in the Character of Harry the Eighth, exhibited at the Royal Academy about twenty years earlier and engraved in mezzotint by John Raphael Smith. Hoppner probably would have seen both. He may also have remembered Reynolds’s source, Remigius van Leemput’s copy of Holbein’s Whitehall mural of 1537, which had been destroyed in a fire in 1698. Leemput’s copy, in the Royal Collection, had been engraved. The Sackvilles were of ancient lineage and connected by marriage to Anne Boleyn, the second wife of Henry VIII and the mother of Elizabeth I. The connection, if understood, would presumably have been appreciated.[2010; adapted from Baetjer 2009]",

        "Catalogue Entry": "This picture is one of numerous night scenes painted by Dou in the 1650s and 1660s. Here, the candle in the midst of the scholars is surely intended as a metaphor for knowledge, a common notion in antiquity and in the seventeenth century. It is possible that Dou intended the lighting of the second candle to convey the idea of learning passed on from teacher to pupil (Liedtke 2007). The act of sharpening a pen signified the notion of practice, which is suggested more literally by the boy who is writing.There are two other slightly later versions of this subject:The Night School(Uffizi, Florence), which is thought to date from about 1660, and a panel of the same title (Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam), probably painted a few years later. An earlier related composition,The Schoolmaster, dated 1645, is in the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge.The irregular edges and lopsided arched top of the panel suggest either that it was cut down along the top or that this is not the original format. The dark maroon-brown curtain that borders the composition along the top is not original.[2010; adapted from Liedtke 2007]",

        "Catalogue Entry": "This painting is stylistically consistent with ones that Bertin exhibited at the official salons, albeit on a small scale that appealed to bourgeois collectors. The eye is led through a cleft in the trees, beyond which an ordered succession of distinct planes culminates in distant mountains, the whole softened by an atmospheric veil of light and shade. At the lower right corner of this idyll, a group of diminutive figures is gathered around an aged poet. Although their role in the overall composition is minor, their presence animates and indeed justifies the composition according to the paradigms of the pastoral and heroic modes of landscape painting, which still retained currency when this painting was executed, in 1803. This convention, already well established in the work of the seventeenth-century masters, was codified in Roger de Piles’s treatise on painting,Cours de peinture par principes(Paris, 1708, pp. 200–205, 228–31).Bertin served as a conduit for trends in Neoclassical landscape painting about 1800. Having studied in Paris under its most influential proponent, Pierre Henri de Valenciennes, Bertin in turn opened his atelier to pupils, the most notable of whom were Achille-Etna Michallon and Camille Corot. Bertin seems to have been preparing for a sojourn in Italy as early as 1797, but it is not known whether this trip was undertaken; he was in Rome by 1805 or early 1806 at the latest. (See Frauke Josenhans, \"Sur le Motif: Painting in Nature around 1800,\"Getty Research Journal, no. 1 [2009], pp.181–82, 189 n. 16.) In any event this panel does not directly reflect experience of the countryside of Italy or its ancient monuments. Rather, it is a vision of nature seen through the filter of Bertin’s seventeenth-century forebears in his chosen field, especially the painter Claude Lorrain and to a lesser extent his contemporaries Gaspard Dughet and Nicolas Poussin.Asher Ethan Miller 2013",

His idealized vision of nature is very much in the manner of French artists active in Rome in the seventeenth century, notably Claude Lorrain. At the end of the eighteenth century, paintings like this one were brought into vogue by Bertin’s teacher, Pierre-Henri de Valenciennes, and served as touchstones to Bertin’s pupils, notably Achille-Etna Michallon and Camille Corot.",

        "Catalogue Entry": "This painting depicts the broad plain that stretches from Tivoli west toward Rome, as seen from the gardens of the Villa d’Este. Consistent with the anecdotal character of the staffage, there are minor deviations from topographical accuracy in matters of detail that include the terrace in the foreground, the doubling in number of the four arches of the Ponte Lucano that span the river Aniene in the near distance, the cursory depiction of the Tomba dei Plauzi and other structures at the bridge’s western terminus, as well as the single hill at right. The artist’s chief preoccupation in this painting, which blurs the boundary between an informal study and a finished painting, is aerial perspective—the combined effect of light and atmosphere to soften distant details, enhancing the illusion of spatial recession.This painting is of a type popularized in the last decades of the eighteenth century by artists such as Louis Gabriel Moreau, called Moreau the Elder (1739–1805), and Hubert Robert (1733–1808), which is exemplified by Robert’sAn Extensive Landscape near Paris, 1781 (Art Gallery of New South Wales, Sydney, inv. 177.1995; see Alan P. Wintermute inClaude to Corot: The Development of Landscape Painting in France, exh. cat., Colnaghi, New York, pp. 215–17, no. 45, ill. [color]). Denis saw works like the Robert in Paris, where he lived for a decade from 1775 until he moved to Rome, probably in 1786. The attribution of the present work to Denis by Whitney is based on the sense of color and the way it is expressed in the brushwork, which are consistent in every way with oil studies that the artist painted in Italy now in the Museum’s collection.Asher Ethan Miller 2013",

        "Catalogue Entry": "The Artist:Some of the most remarkably original still-life paintings of the seventeenth century were created by a little-known nun who practiced her art for some fifty years in a small convent in northern Italy. Theodora Caccia was one of six daughters born to Laura Olivia, herself the daughter of an artist, and Guglielmo Caccia (1568–1625), a Piedmontese painter of religious subjects also known as Il Moncalvo. Guglielmo taught at least two of his daughters to paint in his prolific studio, which received commissions from courts and churches throughout northern Italy. In 1620, at the age of twenty-four, Theodora followed in the footsteps of her four elder sisters and entered the Ursuline convent in Bianzè, a town midway between Milan and Turn; in a conventional sign of marriage to God and participation in a religious order, she took a new name, Orsola (for the Ursulines) Maddalena (for Saint Mary Magdalen). Bianzè was situated on frontier lands between the battling houses of Gonzaga and Savoy, however, prompting Guglielmo to petition the bishop of Casale Monferrato to agree to the establishment of a new Ursuline convent in his safer home city, Moncalvo. This modest convent, founded in 1625, was actually an extension of the family’s home and was funded largely by Guglielmo and Orsola’s painting practice. When Guglielmo died the same year, he left his extensive library, tools, drawings, and other materials for his daughters’ use, thereby encouraging the perpetuation of his style. Indeed, his will outlines several outstanding commissions that Orsola was to complete and monies owed to her for other shared commissions. One of her few dated paintings,The Mystic Marriage of the Blessed Osanna Andreasi(Museo Diocesano, Mantua), commissioned in 1648 by the same bishop of Casale Monferrato, documents Orsola’s continued use of Guglielmo’s figure type: reductive, Mannerist geometries painted with softly blended strokes. But it also includes her tendency toward denser compositions and her characteristic flowers sprinkled across the canvas, each based on her combined study of nature and botanical prints. Beyond her professional success in sustaining the convent, Caccia’s most outstanding accomplishment in terms of painting would be her development of these still-life elements into deeply contemplative, independent paintings. Although they are the most famous of her works today, they constitute only a small percentage of her artistic production. Caccia’s petitions to the court in Turin in the 1640s for commissions and willingness to take in nuns already proficient in painting in the 1660s demonstrate how fundamental the sale of paintings was for sustaining the Ursuline nuns of Moncalvo.Moncalvo’s present-day town hall includes structures that were once part of the Caccia convent, and the city maintains the largest collection of her works. An inventory from 1681 indicates that some of these paintings may have never left their place of execution. Caccia’s works are rare outside of her native region and The Met’s holdings, a gift of Errol M. Rudman, are the most significant outside of Italy.Nuns as Painters:Painting was one among many arts, including manuscript illumination, textiles, horticulture, music, and sculpture that nuns are documented as producing in Italy from the medieval period onward. With the rise in the sixteenth century of drawing and painting as aristocratic pastimes suitable to well-educated women, these skills might have been put to use in religious life; in light of such talents, dowries that were normally presented as part of the entry procedure to a convent may have been waived or reduced. In theory, the Catholic tenants of enclosure (whereby nuns were strictly isolated inside the convent) kept such production outside of circulation, let alone the art market. In reality, however, financial strains often forced convents’ participation in the regional economy through commissions from both the church and private citizens.[1] By the sixteenth century, a number of individual nuns had accrued fame outside their convents’ walls. The most famous, mentioned among the great painters of Italy by Giorgio Vasari (1511–1574), was Plautilla Nelli (1524–1588), who established a flourishing studio in Santa Caterina da Siena, Florence, that lasted into the eighteenth century.[2] This phenomenon coincided with the rise of several Italian women artists, including Sofonisba Anguissola (ca. 1532–1625), Lavinia Fontana (1552–1614), Fede Galizia (ca. 1578–1630), and Artemisia Gentileschi (1593–after 1654). Anguissola and Galizia were, like Caccia, specifically Lombard painters, but all of these artists would have been in the minds of those living in the convent of Moncalvo.Among painters who were also nuns, Caccia might be compared with her almost exact contemporary, Lucrina Fetti (ca. 1590–ca. 1673), sister of the better-known painter Domenico Fetti (1589–1623). Lucrina traveled with her brother to the Mantuan court in 1614, where she painted several portraits. Shortly thereafter, Duke Ferdinando Gonzaga paid her dowry for entry into the Mantuan convent of Sant’Orsola, where she appears to have painted religious subjects, although her works are poorly documented.In 1796, Luigi Lanzi perhaps rightly compared Caccia’s career less to nuns working in convents and more to the more public-facing Fontana and Gentileschi.[3] Through a close inspection of the archival documents, Antonella Chiodo has recently argued that in her convent’s initial decades, Caccia may have more or less painted alone, building on her father’s well-established reputation.[4] For Caccia and her convent, however, painting was far more than a pastime: evidence points to painting as fundamental to sustaining her order’s finances. It seems reasonable, moreover, to assume that in his initial petition to establish a new convent in 1625, Guglielmo’s lively business was factored into its financial feasibility. A painting studio was even included in the architectural plans reviewed by the approving bishop.[5] In 1643, Orsola addressed two letters to Madama Reale Christine of France (1606–1663), Duchess of Savoy, soliciting commissions that, she presented, would support the pressing financial needs of her religious community; in 1665 and 1667, the sisters Laura and Angelica Bottera were accepted to join the convent without committing dowries in light of their talent and willingness to work as painters.[6] Although little is known of their work, the convent’s inventory of 1681 includes “Three others [paintings] / piece of fruit bowls / [all of] the same size by the Misses Bottera”, suggesting that at least part of their practice included still lifes, the genre for which Caccia has become best known.[7]An eighteenth-century painting at The Met by a follower of Alessandro Magnasco (1667–1749; see1982.60.13) depicting nuns occupied at spinning provides an evocative, if fanciful, image of how such workshops might have appeared. A high window with bars makes their separation from the outside world clear; at left, a simple shelf supports a still life that seems to await the paintbrush of a talented nun.The Painting:Of The Met’s three paintings by Orsola Caccia, this still life best captures her original contribution to the history of art: meticulously painted flowers, each individuated in a highly stylized, symmetrical composition. Through a combination of studying botanical prints and natural specimens, Caccia derived calm, meditative images well suited to a spiritual life. Caccia’s core group of such paintings has remained in Moncalvo:Still Life of a Grotesque Vase with Peony, Tulips, and Birds(see fig. 1 above),Still Life of a Grotesque Vase with Sunflower, Flocks, Peonies, Daffodils, Fruit, and Birds(fig. 2), andStill Life of a Grotesque Vase with Lilies, Tulips, Delphinium, and Parrots(fig. 3).[8] The Met’s painting and another that is sometimes referred to as its pendant (private collection; fig. 4) come closest to this group, but are of a squarer format and do not include birds; related, but distinct, are the artist’s two experiments with a horizontal format that incorporate piles of fruit with flowers (see2020.263.2and fig. 5).The Met’s painting is organized around a large peony, a flower that Alberto Cottino calls a kind of “classico” for Caccia, so favored that it almost served as her signature.[9] The similarities of the peony in The Met, the Museo Civico (fig. 1), and the private collection (fig. 5) compositions suggest the possible use of a cartoon slightly modified and changed in orientation through counter-proofing (a process of “printing” a chalk drawing in reverse) or flipping a stenciled pattern in order to trace or pounce the motif. Close comparison of the stem of white lilies in The Met’s painting and the stem of white lilies at the center of one composition of fruit and flowers (fig. 5) demonstrates that in this instance Caccia followed the outline of the form exactly, albeit in reverse and with the addition of morning glories that disguised this repetition.An oil study attributed to Caccia that lines up birds, snails, and flowers across a monochrome ground documents how early modern artists often held motifs in reserve for future use; it is tempting to imagine that in Caccia’s case such studies would have also been consulted by other nuns painting in her convent.[10] Caccia appears to have arrived at these individual motifs through the combined attention to nature (she does not include species that did not plausibly grow in Moncalvo and some works [such as fig. 1], contain plants that bloomed in a specific month) and botanical prints. Individual plates or entire volumes of works such as Basilius Besler’sHortus Eystettensis(1613) were likely found in the library that she inherited from her father in 1625. Not unlike the tradition of pressed flowers, or herbaria, these prints typically presented flower stems as if one with the picture plane, resulting in a meticulous attention to detail and a strong two-dimensionality that lends itself to a patternlike effect. Caccia’s artistic originality—and idiosyncrasy—was to retain the individuation of each motif when placing it in her still lifes and to arrange them symmetrically and evenly across the surface of her pictures. The formal effect is extremely calm and stable, but also leans toward a sense of abstraction and decoration. Prints after Jakob Hoefnagel (50.562.103(5)), which juxtapose flowers with blackwork ornament, provide an insightful comparison and make more explicit the way in which botanical and decorative aspects were explored simultaneously in Caccia’s paintings.For the devout, Caccia’s still lifes would have had a more complex relationship to the language of flowers or a “Christian botany” (see The Timeline of Art History“Botanical Imagery in European Painting”). In this context, the repetition of motifs is not just a result of artistic practice or formal concerns, but also a means of composing units of information. Gatherings of flowers in general were understood as symbolizing the Garden of Eden, while the convent was conceptualized as a closed garden, the walls of which protected the purity (or, more explicitly, the virginity) of its inhabitants. In the present still life, the white lily, representative of the Virgin Mary’s purity, was often included in Annunciation scenes (for example,17.190.7) and attested to Christ’s divine conception; another floral stand-in for Mary was the peony, a “rose without thorns” that Saint Ambrose claimed was part of the Garden of Eden prior to the fall of Adam and Eve. Inclusion of large, bearded irises, also known as sword lilies, may refer to Simeon’s prophecy to Mary of Christ’s death in the Gospel of Luke that “thy own soul a word shall pierce.” As described by Saint Francis of Sales (1567–1622; canonized 1665), flower bouquets might be “read” in this way as a series of thoughts during meditation. Caccia would almost certainly have known hisDevout Life(1609), a popular text in the Piedmont region, Savoy court, and Ursuline circles, in which he used the bouquet analogy not only for the individual in prayer, but also for the composition of his book: “The flower-girl Glycera was so skilled in varying the arrangement and combination of her flowers that out of the same kinds she produced a great variety of bouquets; so that the [4th B.C., Greek] painter Pausias, who sought to rival the diversity of her art, was brought to a standstill, for he could not vary his paintings so endlessly as Glycera varied her bouquet. Even so, the Holy Spirit of God disposes and arranges the devout teaching with which He imparts through the lips and pen of His servants with such endless variet . . . I offer you the same flowers, dear reader, but the bouquet will be somewhat different.”[11]In contrast to the fidelity with which Caccia treated individual plant species, her zoomorphic vases, which often allow multiple openings for protruding flowers, appear to be wholly fanciful.[12] The Met’s example, with a mouthlike spout and leafy scales around its body, is particularly exuberant. Scholars have cited possible sources in Milanese metalwork, and similarly asymmetrical ewer forms are known in Medici porcelain, but many of Caccia’s vessels could only exist on canvas or on paper (see, for instance, the handles of fig. 1).[13] In terms of how they animate her still lifes, such vases relate to the group of seventeenth-century Italian painters known as “I Maestri del vaso a grottesche” (Masters of the Grotesque Vases) who either invented forms themselves or looked to prints sources such as Enea Vico (1543;2012.136.400.4), Aegidius Sadeler II (1605), and Stefano della Bella (2012.136.99.1). Caccia typically picks out the eyes of her zoomorphic forms in black, evocative of inlay, but the overall white palette further suggests monochromatic prints as her source. By the middle decades of the seventeenth century, a number of printmakers, such as Nicolaes de Bruyn's (1571–1656) engravings after Jacob Savery I (1566–1603;51.501.1135), brought together these fanciful vases with the birds and meticulously depicted, symmetrical bouquets of flowers found in Caccia’s paintings.No doubt it was through not one but a wide range of printed and, perhaps, painted sources in dialogue with actual specimens from nature that Caccia arrived at her remarkable still-life paintings. In a much broader sense, print culture probably also best explains the striking phenomenon of artists exploring such meticulous, individuated treatment of flowers and fruit across Europe in the first half of the seventeenth century. Rather than follow Fede Galizia, the pioneer of Lombard still life, Caccia’s most remarkable paintings actually have greater affinities with artists much farther afield, such as Hoefnagel, Jan Brueghel the Elder (1568–1625), Juan Sánchez Cotán (1560–1627), or Francisco de Zurbarán (see27.137).[14] Responding to similar trends and sources, each painter arrived at their own original contributions to the genre. The abstract quality that these painters achieved has often proved appealing to modernist sensibilities, and reverberations of their legacy can be seen in artists such as Honoré Sharrer (1920–2009;1996.404) and Kehinde Wiley (b. 1977;2009.14).The letter \"F\" on the reverse of this painting (fig. 6) connects it with the significant early group of works by Caccia and her father that were in the collection of Ferdinando Dal Pozzo (1768–1843) in her hometown of Moncalvo.[15]David Pullins 2020[1] From the extensive literature, see Jeffrey Hamburger, “Art, Enclosure and the Cura Monialium:Prolegomena in the Guise of a Postscript,”Gesta,31.2 (1992), pp. 108–34 and Marilyn Dunn, “Convent Creativity” inThe Ashgate Research Companion to Women and Gender in Early Modern Europe,eds.

        "Intro Description": "Caccia ran a painting studio that supported a convent at Moncalvo founded by her father, the painter Guglielmo Caccia (1568–1625). The strongly individuated elements evenly distributed across a monochrome background result in a captivating effect of surface pattern. These features were well suited to religious meditation and were probably derived from her study of Northern European botanical prints.",

        "Catalogue Entry": "The Artist:Van Rysselberghe was a leader of the vibrant artistic avant-garde that arose in Belgium in the last two decades of the nineteenth century. He received a traditional art education at state institutions, but, soon after completing his training in the early 1880s, he began to chart a more independent path. In 1883, he was a founding member of Les XX, an artists’ circle based in Brussels that exhibited trailblazing work from across Europe. Van Rysselberghe’s immersion in Belgium’s progressive art world dramatically shaped his development. He had been positioning himself as a painter of scenes of everyday life, inspired by his travels to Spain and Morocco, but he soon began to make paintings inspired by artists who exhibited at Les XX, particularly James McNeill Whistler and the French Impressionists.In the spring of 1886, Van Rysselberghe saw Georges Seurat’s groundbreaking pointillist masterpieceA Sunday on La Grande Jatte — 1884(see fig. 1 above) at the eighth Impressionist exhibition in Paris. This painting and others by Seurat and Camille Pissarro also made a splash at Les XX in early 1887. Over the course of the next year, Van Rysselberghe and several other Belgian artists began to experiment with pointillism (also called divisionism), a demanding method that involved creating an image out of small, regular dots of color placed side-by-side on the canvas. Van Rysselberghe quickly became one of pointillism’s most talented and dedicated exponents. He forged a close friendship with the leading French pointillist painter Paul Signac, working with him to develop and promote their new style.[1] Van Rysselberghe’s pointillist period, between roughly 1889 and 1903, is considered the high point of his career. He was a supremely gifted landscapist, but the genre that he truly made his own was pointillist portraiture.The Sitter:The portrait depicts Van Rysselberghe’s six-year-old niece, Denise Maréchal, the daughter of Dr. Edouard Amédée Maréchal and Irma Monnom. Irma’s sister, Maria Monnom, married Van Rysselberghe in September 1889, the year the portrait was made. The Monnom family was a distinguished one: their publishing house, headed by the matriarch Sylvie Marie-Thérèse Monnom-Descamps, produced the cutting-edge artistic and literary journalsL’Art moderneandLa Jeune Belgique, as well as posters and exhibition catalogues for Les XX and its successor, La Libre Esthétique. Van Rysselberghe painted a number of portraits of the extended Monnom family, including a smaller, bust-length portrait of Denise Maréchal (fig. 2), made about 1894 and owned by Madame Monnom.The Painting:Painted about a year after Van Rysselberghe took up pointillism in earnest,Little Deniseshows him in full command of the challenging technique, and already developing an individual variation on the principles of Seurat and Signac. Block (1993) considers the painting to be Van Rysselberghe’s first mature pointillist portrait. His technical skill is evident in the finely tuned variations of brushwork and color that comprise the image. In the background, bold dots in vivid hues create an abstract, patterned effect. In the figure’s face, delicate dabs of paint capture the nuances of the girl’s expression. Her gaze and pose suggest a combination of sweetness and innocence on the one hand, and great seriousness and assertiveness, on the other. The portrayal is undiluted by the traditional trappings of child portraits—toys, pets, and playful attitudes— and the sitter’s personality is conveyed with sympathy and power. Van Rysselberghe enhanced the impression of the girl’s youth by positioning her next to a marble mantelpiece and underneath a hanging scroll: she is a small child holding her own in an adult world. Her portrait exemplifies the naturalism and expressiveness that the artist brought to the analytical rigor of pointillism.Pictorial Sources:The open-minded, international milieu of the Belgian avant-garde exposed Van Rysselberghe to the work of some of the most prominent and innovative artists of his day. Among the most likely sources of inspiration forLittle Deniseis the art of his idol, Whistler, and in particularHarmony in Grey and Green: Miss Cicely Alexander(fig. 3), exhibited at Les XX in 1884.Little Denisealso recalls the portrait of the young Jeanne Kéfer by Belgian artist Fernand Khnopff (fig. 4), shown at Les XX in 1886 (and perhaps also influenced by Whistler). Van Rysselberghe, an accomplished portraitist of children, would have been well aware of such progressive examples of the genre. An interesting point of contrast withLittle Deniseis the little girl wearing a belted white dress who appears in the center of Seurat’sA Sunday on La Grande Jatte — 1884(fig. 1). This streamlined figure, so different from Van Rysselberghe’s individualized, emotionally penetrating portrayal, indicates how the Belgian artist adapted pointillism to meet the demands of portraiture.One of the most striking aspects ofLittle Deniseis the composition. Angled, cropped, and radically simplified, it is more dynamic and inventive than the settings of most of Van Rysselberghe’s portraits. The rigorous geometric structure of horizontal and vertical planes, articulated with patterned brushwork, is akin to the purified, linear harmonies that Seurat and Signac were exploring at the time. However, instead of adopting the stylized, flattened poses seen in Seurat’sA Sunday on La Grande Jatte — 1884andModels (Poseuses)(fig. 5) (exhibited at Les XX in 1889), Van Rysselberghe depicts Denise in a more spontaneous pose. The little girl leans casually against the wall, the top of her head just breaking the line of the dado, and turns slightly toward the viewer—a subtle yet unmistakable note of unaffected naturalness within the strictly organized scene.In creating this composition, Van Rysselberghe may have been channeling Edgar Degas, whose work he knew and was keen to exhibit at Les XX.[2] Another possible source for the composition is Japanese art. Like many European artists, Van Rysselberghe was intrigued by Japanese paintings and prints as compelling alternatives to academic conventions of representation. He was collecting Japanese prints by 1887, and several of his portraits from the period depict Japanese works of art and/or appear to draw stylistic inspiration from Japanese precedents. The hanging scroll inLittle Denise, which is signed with Van Rysselberghe’s monogram, is one example of this pictorial citation. The image on the scroll is indistinct and has not been identified, but the format echoes that of a common Japanese style of mounting paintings and calligraphy, calledkakemonoorkakejiku.[3]The reference to Japanese art inLittle Deniseemphasizes the modernity of the portrait. In 1889, the year that it was painted, Belgium’s first major exhibitions of Japanese art were held in Brussels. In February, the influential Paris-based dealer Siegfried Bing organized a display of paintings, prints, and objects at the Cercle artistique et littéraire. In May, the Belgian musicographer and collector Edmond Michotte organized another show at the Palais des Beaux-Arts. The government purchased important Japanese works for what are now the Musées royaux d’Art et d’Histoire, giving an official seal of approval to the interest in Japanese art and culture.Early Exhibitions and Critical Response:Van Rysselberghe clearly consideredLittle Deniseto be a major achievement. He exhibited it in 1890 in two high-profile exhibition venues: at Les XX in Belgium and at his debut at the Salon des Indépendants in Paris, along with other portraits and landscapes. Numerous critics praised the portrait, but it has not been the subject of extended analysis until now. However,Little Deniseis consistently cited in the literature as one of Van Rysselberghe’s most successful works and as a premier example of the psychological acumen that he brought to pointillism (see References).Alison Hokanson 2019[1] Marina Ferretti Bocquillon, “Signac and Van Rysselbergh [sic]: The story of a friendship, 1887–1907,”Apollo147 (June 1998), pp. 11–18.[2] Chartrain-Hebbelinck and Mertens 1966, pp. 60–62, 66, 70, letters 2, 3, 8, 11.[3] On thejaponisteaspects of Van Rysselberghe’s art and its context, see Yoko Takagi,Japonisme in fin de siècle art in Belgium, Antwerp, 2002, pp. 38–39, 141–45, and Elisabeth Brasseur-Cescutti, \"Siegfried Bing, organisateur de l’exposition de peinture et d’estampe japonaise au Cercle artistique et littéraire de Bruxelles en 1889,\" inSiegfried Bing & la Belgique, Brussels, 2010, pp. 194–211.",

        "Catalogue Entry": "The Artist:For a biography of Dieric Bouts, see the Catalogue Entry forVirgin and Child(30.95.280).The Painting:When this painting was shown at the “Toison d’Or” exhibition in Bruges in 1907 (see Exhibition History), it appeared as a small independent portrait (see fig. 1 above). After it entered The Met’s collection in 1932, the panel was studied with x-radiography (see Technical Notes). This revealed that the painting, in fact, is a fragment, for it showed that behind the man is a partial figure whose right hand touches the man’s back. The painting was cleaned in 1949 (Hochfield 1976), and the overpaint of the background was carefully removed, exposing vestiges of a standing figure wearing a plum-colored robe. The gesture of his right hand is common in early Netherlandish painting, indicating the presentation by a saint of a kneeling donor to holy figures, such as the Virgin and Child. The saint is probably John the Baptist, who is often represented with bare arms, as here, and wearing a red cloak with a rough camel-hair garment beneath. This discovery made clear that this is not an independent portrait, but instead a fragment of a larger work, quite possibly part of a single devotional panel or the left wing of a small triptych.The unknown man is presented with a deeply earnest expression as if transfixed by the devotional image at his left on which he meditates. His hair is cut fashionably short in the style of the day. He wears a blue, fur-lined robe with a plum-colored undergarment; the black cornette of his chaperon is tossed over his right shoulder.The Attribution and Date:At the Bruges “Toison d’Or” exhibition, the painting carried an attribution to Jan van Eyck, although its owner, Édouard Warneck, followed by Émile Durand-Gréville (1910), instead had proposed Jan’s elder brother, Hubert. The strong tradition of Eyckian naturalism evident in the portrait understandably accounts for these early attributions, which even resurfaced later on in terms of a “close follower” of Van Eyck (Wehle and Salinger 1947, Larsen 1960).Alternatively, Max J. Friedländer placed this impressive likeness firmly within the oeuvre of Dieric Bouts (Friedländer 1916, 1925, 1928), and this was met with general agreement (see especially Conway 1921, Lugt 1926, Burroughs and Weale 1932, and further in References). Renewed scrutiny of the development of Bouts’s career, especially by Baldass (1932) and Schöne (1938) led these scholars to offer refinements on attributions, associating certain paintings with workshop assistants. Baldass linked The Met’s fragment to the so-called Master of the Pearl of Brabant, while Schöne (see also Périer-d’Ieteren 2006) ascribed the panel to the Master of the Betrayal of Christ and the Resurrection—both of whose name paintings are in the Alte Pinakothek, Munich. Further distancing the Friedsam fragment from Bouts’s works, Campbell (1981) and Bauman (1986) endorsed a connection with the paintings of a Bouts follower, the Haarlem painter Albert van Ouwater, specifically with hisRaising of Lazarus(Gemäldegalerie, Berlin, fig. 2).With more recent technical examinations of the works of Dieric Bouts and Albert van Ouwater, it is now possible to firm up the question of attribution for this portrait.[1] Another portrait fragment in The Met collection is so close to the head of Saint Peter in Ouwater’sRaising of Lazarusthat it must be by the same hand (see the online entry for The Met,17.190.22). This makes it possible to compare the two portrait fragments, the one by Ouwater and the one currently under discussion (fig. 3). The Ouwater portrait shows a strikingly graphic approach to the physiognomy with sharply defined facial features, and deeply etched lines for the wrinkles of the brow, surrounding the eyes, the sagging jowls, and near the right ear. Heightened contrasts of light and dark emphasize the three-dimensionality of these facial features. In The Met's portrait this approach is muted, revealing a much more subtle treatment of the face and its modeling. Contours are softened, wrinkles are smoothed out, and a more delicate approach renders a sympathetic impression of the man’s psychological state (see Technical Notes).This portrait is a different head type compared to the long, oval-shaped heads in Dieric Bouts’s independent male portrait of 1462 in the National Gallery, London, or the portrait fragment of around 1470 (The Met,14.40.644). However, the current fragment, in fact, is quite close in its technique and handling to other works of Bouts, especially to some of the heads in his great masterpiece, theHoly Sacrament Altarpieceproduced in 1464–67 for Saint Peter’s Church in Leuven.[2] In particular, the attendant with downcast eyes and folded hands, standing behind Saint Peter in the central panel of the altarpiece shares a strikingly similar approach to the physiognomy (fig. 4). Although the Friedsam portrait represents a square head shape, and different facial features, the modelling of the face is nonetheless quite comparable to one of the attendant figures in the Leuven altarpiece (fig. 5). The faces are lit from the left with the proper left side cast in shadow. The features of the face are clearly defined but softly modeled. Wrinkles at the brow are muted as they are around the mouth and chin in nearly exact locations. Highlights are placed on the bridges and tips of the noses, while shading to the right of the pouches under the eyes and beneath the lower lips and at the chin convey supple flesh. The ears of the two heads are distinctly alike in their formation as is the demarcation between the necks and the jaws of the heads where a slightly emerging beard is evident in each.The underdrawing of The Met’s fragment was executed in a liquid medium with bold strokes delineating the contours of folds of the man’s garment (see Technical Notes and fig. 6). Finer, lighter strokes in the proper right sleeve provide parallel hatching at an angle to the more strongly marked folds, suggesting the volume of forms. At the right, oblique parallel hatching covers a broader area, denoting the side in shadow. These distinct characteristics of the underdrawing match those found in Bouts’sHoly Sacrament Altarpiece, specifically in the scenes ofElijah in the Desertand theGathering of the Manna(Périer-d’Ieteren 2006, pp. 94–100, figs. 74, 80). A final detail also links this fragment with Bouts. The plum-colored robe of the saint behind the donor portrait is modeled on the paint surface with parallel hatching in a deeper-toned glaze. This is a typical feature of the painting technique of Bouts, his workshop, and his close followers. As Périer-d’Ieteren has noted, “the painter places small, dark, graphic accents in the glazes as a way of rendering the texture and shading of the fabric” (Périer-d’Ieteren 2006, p. 106). This portrait fragment is so close to Bouts’s approach to handling and execution in his paintings that it confidently can be attributed to him.Given the stylistic connections with Bouts’sHoly Sacrament Altarpiece, including the costume and short haircut of the portraitlike figure at the far left in theMeeting of Abraham and Melchizedek(on the upper left wing of the altarpiece),[3]  this portrait fragment most likely dates to 1460–65. Peter Klein’s dendrochronology suggests a probable date of creation of the painting from 1439 on (see Technical Notes).Maryan W.

        "Technical Notes": "Support:This painting on panel is a fragment of a larger painting: no original edges remain but clues in the painted image suggest that much of the composition is missing. Undoubtedly, the figure preserved only in his arm and middle, most likely that of John the Baptist (see Catalogue Entry), would have been painted in his entirety and the body of the donor—seemingly kneeling in front of the standing saint—would also have been fully included. At the far left, there is a sliver of bright red and then a small amount of light green paint above that. The bright red and green are not related to either figure and are positioned behind the plum-colored robe, thus must belong to the background, other objects, or—as is particularly likely for the bright red—the drapery of another figure. At the far right is another sliver of a light green paint that belongs to something positioned in front of the standing saint’s robe. Its shape recalls a drapery fold, pointing to yet another figure. The presence of at least three, possibly four, figures would make this a sizable panel, of which only a tiny fragment is preserved.Evidence from the panel support also indicates that it was formerly significantly larger. A join located 11.3 cm from the left edge of the support, just to the right of the donor figure’s face, reveals that the original panel was constructed from at least two vertically oriented boards, thus much larger overall. The vertical orientation of the boards also suggests that the original panel was a vertical rectangle. The original panel now measures about 5 mm thick on average, but it is currently adhered to a 3 mm mahogany board and cradled, thus it was likely planed down somewhat prior to the work on the back. There are bevels on the reverse of the original panel, at the top and bottom edges only, now filled with narrow wood inserts. The bevels must have been related to the framing of the panel after it was cut away from the rest of the composition. Dendrochronological analysis of the original panel revealed an earliest possible creation date of 1433 and a more plausible date of 1439 onwards.[1] The wood is oak that originated in the Baltic/Polish region.Preparation:The panel was prepared with a whitish ground, likely containing chalk. Examination with infrared reflectography revealed the presence of an underdrawing executed using a liquid medium (see fig. 6 above).[2] It appears that the artist planned out all of the important contour lines in his underdrawing, including the facial features and drapery, although the lines are sometimes difficult to see in the reflectogram where they were followed closely by the painted forms or, in places, because some lines are simply faint in appearance. The underdrawing can easily be distinguished where the painted composition introduced a change, as in the height of the sitter’s proper right shoulder, or where the artist added hatchmarks, lying across the torso and in the proper left sleeve. The appearance of the underdrawn lines varies in the reflectogram from relatively faint to quite bold, at the donor’s proper left shoulder, for example. In general, the underdrawing appears to be neat, the contour lines generally followed with paint, and the hatchmarks regularly spaced parallel lines.Paint Layers:The painting was executed with great subtlety. The artist observed specific details closely and then translated his understanding of the human face into paint with impressive nuances. See, for example, how he created three-dimensionality in the wrinkles by not only limning the deep creases with light touches of brown paint but also suggesting how light would catch the folds of skin underneath and, most impressively, how the horizontal wrinkles of the forehead undulate ever so slightly as they traverse the man’s knitted brow. On an even smaller scale, he suggested the man’s pale, nearly colorless, eyelashes by dragging the still wet paint of the man’s eye lid down to create lashes (fig. 7) And through a complex buildup of paint, he rendered the fur collar naturalistically, with pale yellow transitioning smoothly around the edge to dark brown at the inner edge.It appears that the flesh tones were built up primarily using warm glazes; the artist restricted his use of white to highlights, as can be seen in the x-radiograph (fig. 8). Interestingly, a light scattering of blue pigments is apparent in the flesh tones. The blue is not enough to truly impact the hue of the skin but lends a very subtly cool tone to the man’s skin in shaded regions, for example, at his temple or near the jawline.When the painting entered The Met’s collection in 1932, the figure in the background was entirely obscured with overpaint, which had transformed the fragment into a standalone portrait (fig. 1). It was only when the painting was x-rayed and ultimately when the overpaint was removed, in 1949, that the original background was rediscovered. Fortunately, it was possible to remove the overpaint safely at that time, and the painting, including the background, remains impressively well preserved. Small islands of overpaint can be seen under magnification and show that the overpaint was a medium to dark gray.Sophie Scully 2023[1] Wood identification and dendrochronological analysis completed by Dr. Peter Klein, Universität Hamburg, report dated May 13, 1997. The report can be found in the files of the Department of Paintings Conservation. “The youngest heartwood ring was formed out in the year 1422. Regarding the sapwood statistic of Eastern Europe an earliest felling date can be derived for the year 1431, more plausible is a felling date between 1435..1437….1441 + x. With a minimum of 2 years for seasoning an earliest creation of the painting is possible from 1433 upwards. Under the assumption of a median of 15 sapwood rings and 2 years for seasoning, a creation is plausible from 1439 upwards.”[2] Infrared reflectography was acquired with an OSIRIS InGaAs near-infrared camera fitted with a 6-element, 150 mm focal length f/5.6–f/45 lens; 900-1700 nm spectral response, February 2023.",

        "Intro Description": "Altarpieces were sometimes dismantled and cut into smaller fragments in later centuries. In this case, the original religious panel included a full-length portrait of the kneeling donor with his patron saint. At some point he was cut out from the waist up, and the background was repainted in a uniform, dark color to make the painting look like an independent portrait. With the overpaint now removed, the panel’s fragmentary condition is evident.",

New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2000–.The Painting:This Crucifixion distills the biblical narrative found in Matthew (27:33–56), Mark (15:22–41), Luke (23:32–49), and John (19:17–37), to the main protagonists: Christ on the cross, the swooning Virgin Mary collapsing in the arms of Saint John the Evangelist, and Mary Magdalen kneeling in prayerful adoration. The significant addition here is Saint Jerome, identified by his cardinal’s red robe and hat at the back of his head, a cruciform staff in his right hand, and his attribute, the lion, wandering in the background. Jerome, however, is psychologically distant from the event. He experiences the Crucifixion as a spiritual vision by reading about it in the book he holds. This likely refers to Jerome’s own translation of the Bible from Hebrew and Greek into Latin in the fourth century, his seminal contribution to Christendom.The apt setting for the Crucifixion is Golgotha, literally the place of the skull (here strewn with a femur and a jaw bone), situated outside the city walls of Jerusalem. The latter is suggested in the landscape beyond by a rendition of the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, believed to be the burial site of Christ. The sky has darkened, according to Matthew 27: 45, indicating the time of Christ’s death: \"Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour.\"At this moment of death, Jesus makes a gesture of blessing with his right hand in recognition of the new relationship between John and his mother, Mary. To the Virgin, Christ said, “Woman, Behold your son!” And to John, he uttered, “Behold your Mother” (John 19:26–27). In sorrow, John looks up at Christ, while the Virgin crosses her hands over her heart in resignation, sharing compassion for her son in his agony and sacrifice for humankind. Mary Magdalen, a repentant sinner, serves as an example for the viewer’s own devotional entreaty to Christ for forgiveness and salvation.The Attribution and Date:The attribution of this painting to David has never been challenged. Early scholarly opinions of Bodenhausen and Valentiner (1911), as well as Conway (1921), placed it relatively late in the artist’s career. However, the landscape construction, figure types, and palette all point to David’s earlier style of around 1490. During this period, David’s landscapes still fell under the influence of Dieric Bouts in such works as the left wing of theHoly Sacrament Altarpiece, showing Abraham and Melchizedek (see fig. 1 above). Here we find similar overlapping wedges of landscape and rocky masses receding from the foreground into the distance, in tonal transitions from browns, to mid-greens, and blue hues at the far horizon line. David’s sweet, soft facial types are perhaps a response to the great popularity of the art of his older contemporary in Bruges, Hans Memling. His preference for orange-reds, olive-greens, and gray-blues can be seen as well in other paintings that traditionally date to this period between 1490–1500, such as two Lamentations, one in the Philadelphia Museum of Art (fig. 2), and the other in the Art Institute of Chicago (fig. 3). The latter of these shows a similar depiction of the Church of the Holy Sepulcher in the background, suggesting that the two perhaps came from the same workshop model.The composition is a traditional one, probably studied in a stock workshop drawing that was the inspiration for David’s followers, especially of the Adriaen Isenbrant group, in a number of variations.[1] It is not a surprise that the Saint Jerome figure is the most fully studied in the underdrawing, as this is the addition to an otherwise standard arrangement of figures. The drawing appears to be in a dry medium and rather closely followed in the paint layers, except for the lose sketch for Mary Magdalen’s sleeves that bears no resemblance to the exquisitely painted, tight, rhythmic undulations of the golden cloth (figs. 4, 5). The zig-zag folds of Jerome’s red robe and the fall of his draperies are similar to features found in David’s Frankfurt drawing for the standing King Cambyses in theJustice of Cambysespanels already begun by the mid-1490s and completed in 1498 (Ainsworth 1998, pp. 124–25, and p. 14, fig. 10).Likely Commission and Function:Given the prominent position of Saint Jerome in this painting, the image was probably intended for use within the Order of Saint Jerome, or the Hieronymites, a religious order living according to the Rule of Saint Augustine. Prompted by the image, specific texts would have been recited during devotional practice. In the fifteenth-century Office of Saint Jerome, there are prayers in the voice of the saint as he beseeches Christ crucified not simply for himself, a miserable sinner, but on behalf of his relatives and friends: Deign to free my soul from sin, turn my heart / from wicked and depraved thoughts, free my / body and soul from servitude to sin, drive / concupiscence from me.\" And praying for mercy and eternal life, he implores: \"Spare, O Lord, your people, whom you, Lord / Jesus Christ, have redeemed with your blood; / Spare them and do not forget them in eternity.[2]At some point this panel may have been joined with another painting. There are remnants of two hinges at the left on the original frame edge (figs. 7, 8). The frame element at the right side was replaced.Maryan W. Ainsworth 2019[1] For examples, see Max J. Friedländer,Early Netherlandish PaintingVol. 11,The Antwerp Mannerists, Adriaen Ysenbrant, comments and Notes by Henri Pauwels, Leiden, 1974, nos. 156–63, pls. 126–28.[2] E. F. Rice,Saint Jerome in the Renaissance, Baltimore, 1985, p. 80.",
        "Technical Notes": "Support:The support was constructed from two planks of oak, with the grain oriented vertically. Dendrochronological analysis indicated an earliest possible creation date of 1491 with a more plausible date of 1497 onwards.[1] The wood originated in the Baltic/Polish region. The original panel was thinned to 4 mm, mounted to a 7 mm thick panel and cradled.  A barbe is present along all edges, indicating that the original dimensions of the painting are preserved and that the panel was prepared with an engaged frame in place. The painting retains its original frame, except for the right vertical member that is a later replacement (see figs. 7, 8 above).Preparation:The panel was prepared with a white ground. Examination with infrared reflectography revealed the presence of an underdrawing, which appears to have been largely executed with a dry material (fig. 4).[2] David planned out his composition with seemingly rapid strokes, focusing on the important contours of figures and adding only a few lines for the landscape. The artist worked up the folds of Mary Magdalen’s sleeves in a very sketchy manner, with the result that the forms are rather difficult to decipher (fig. 5). But this was not a hindrance to the artist, as the overlying painted sleeves were confidently painted and among the most beautiful passages in the composition. In general, the artist did not include shading, except for a few areas of rough hatchmarks in Jerome’s red robe and Mary Magdalen’s blue cloak. In these areas he appears to have gone over the lines indicating the deepest folds with a liquid material, perhaps to clarify these passages.Paint Layers:The painting was executed with great sensitivity.  As noted in several of his other paintings, David mixed in some white and grey to the fleshtones, which here helped him achieve the marblelike coolness of the mourning figures, particularly the Virgin and Mary Magdalen, offset by their red-rimmed eyes. In contrast, David modeled Jerome’s fleshtones with more brown and reddish glazes, giving him an altogether warmer appearance. This serves to disassociate Jerome from the other figures, who are visually united in their grief, while he is at a psychological remove, reading the account of the scene. This slight discrepancy in the fleshtones is evident in the distribution of lead white in the x-radiograph (fig. 6). Notably, there is a greater amount of lead white in Mary Magdalen’s face and chest, and examination of the painting suggests that the artist reworked her face somewhat.David’s affinity for small details is on display, such as the remarkable three-dimensionality of the nail in Christ’s feet or the staff in Jerome’s hand, which subtly reflects his red robe. He also displayed his mastery of fabrics and textures, in the contrast between Mary Magdalen’s stiffchangeantfabric sleeves, the delicate wrinkles in Jerome’s gloves, and the soft fur lining of his robe.The painting has suffered some abrasion, likely during an insensitive past cleaning—most noticeable in the sky, where upper layers of paint are rubbed at cracks. It appears that an upper green glaze was also partly removed from Mary Magdalen’s green robe, revealing the brighter—and less resolved—green underlayer. The paint mixtures have also undergone some age-related changes. Many of the green glazes in the landscape have discolored to a warm brown, as is characteristic of copper-containing greens. The Virgin’s blue dress has darkened with age, rendering the definition of the folds of her drapery less legible. A red lake appears to have faded in Mary Magdalen’schangeantsleeves.Sophie Scully 2020[1] Wood identification and dendrochronological analysis completed by Dr. Peter Klein, Universität Hamburg, report dated May 12, 1997. The report can be found in the files of the Department of Paintings Conservation. “The youngest heartwood ring was formed out in the year 1480. Regarding the sapwood statistic of Eastern Europe an earliest felling date can be derived for the year 1489, more plausible is a felling date between 1493..1495….1499 + x. With a minimum of 2 years for seasoning an earliest creation of the painting is possible from 1491 upwards. Under the assumption of a median of 15 sapwood rings and 8 years for seasoning, as probably usual in the 14th/15th century, a creation is plausible from 1497 upwards.”[2] Infrared reflectography was acquired with an OSIRIS InGaAs near-infrared camera fitted with a 6-element, 150 mm focal length f/5.6–f/45 lens; 900-1700 nm spectral response.

        "Intro Description": "During the late spring of 1867 Bazille visited the town of Aigues-Mortes near his family home in Montpellier. Hoping for \"at least eight beautiful days,\" he set himself the challenge of painting \"absolutely simple\" landscapes of the city and surrounding marshes. Of the artist’s three known views of the area, this is the only one to show the massive medieval walls of Aigues-Mortes from up close. It also displays the most striking light effects: the southern sun shines brightly through the archway, contrasting with the afternoon shadows that envelop the grazing Camargue pony and the figures in the foreground.",

        "Intro Description": "This painting, acquired as by Aert de Gelder, has for decades been assigned either to Rembrandt's cousin Karel van der Pluym (1625–1672), or to Heyman Dullaert (1636–1684), a Rotterdam poet and painter who was Rembrandt's pupil in the early 1650s. The connection with Dullaert is encouraged by Arnold Houbraken's reference (1721) to a canvas by Dullaert,The God of War Mars in a Reflecting Cuirass, that was sold as a Rembrandt in Amsterdam. However, the subject was fairly common (e.g., the famousMan in the Golden Helmetin Berlin, now attributed to an unknown Rembrandt pupil), and the present picture has little in common with Dullaert's few surviving works. Its style and subject do recall several paintings by Van der Pluym, though most of them are of lesser quality.",

        "Catalogue Entry": "Topography:This landscape, with nothing architectural to distinguish it, was titledUne route près de Louvecienneswhen it was first exhibited in 1927 and by François Daulte, author of the 1959 Sisley catalogue raisonné. Based on style, he assigned the canvas to 1879. Sisley was living at the time in busy suburban Sèvres, having left the country village of Louveciennes two years earlier. However, the distance between the two is not great. The main thoroughfare from Saint-Germain-en-Laye to Versailles passes through Louveciennes, and in 1979, Jacques de Laÿ, a local resident, identified this stretch of road as the approach to the former royal park of Marly (which lies on high ground above the Seine river valley).The Painting:The composition is organized around the straight diagonal of the road, which is set off by three trees in leaf, two on the near side and one further away, beside a harvested field, suggesting that the season is late summer or early autumn. The sky especially is painted loosely, with a few bright pink flecks among the branches of the largest tree and several dry sweeping and curving brushstrokes to accentuate the shape of the tree furthest to the right. These strokes are deliberately left visible. A laborer wheels a cart in one direction while a man in formal dress wearing a black top hat, who has already passed by, turns to look over his shoulder. The figures are typical of Sisley in that they are without facial features, tall, and with their limbs carelessly indicated, the man in black with bent, stilt-like legs. In the 1870s in the countryside, most people traveled very significant distances on foot, as the artist himself would have done throughout his career in search of his subjects.Katharine Baetjer 2020",

        "Intro Description": "In the 1870s, Sisley, like his colleagues Monet and Pissarro, often painted the roads, bridges, and waterways linking Paris with the rapidly suburbanizing villages to the north and west. This picture depicts a site near the town of Louveciennes, on the main thoroughfare between Versailles and Saint-Germain-en-Laye. Sisley's juxtaposition of two figures on the road—a laborer pushing a cart and a man wearing a sophisticated black suit and top hat—evokes the contrast between old-fashioned country life and modern urban society. The loose, summary brushwork is characteristic of Sisley’s technique in the latter part of the decade.",

        "Catalogue Entry": "The Artist:Pierre-Auguste Cot (1837–1883) came from Bédarieux in Languedoc, a southern province of France. He was a student of the history and portrait painter Léon Cogniet and two of the titans of Academic painting, Alexandre Cabanel and William Bouguereau. His early paintings exhibited at the Salon included portraits as well as mythological paintings and nude studies. Cot’sSpringtime(The Met,2012.575) appeared at the Paris Salon of 1873 and was a great success there and thereafter, fostering many repetitions in almost every conceivable format: paintings, etchings, engravings, lithographs, colored photographs, tapestries, fans, and porcelain. Cot was made achevalierof the Legion of Honor the next year but chased the legacy of hisSpringtimefame in the also-widely-reproducedThe Stormand then unsuccessfully in portraits of fashionable women ever after, and died in his forties of liver disease.The Painting:Seven years after paintingSpringtime, Cot produced what has been called this \"spiritual pendant\" (Rubin 1980), a canvas that is similarly over life-size. The Met’s great patron Catharine Lorillard Wolfe, the cousin of John Wolfe, then owner ofSpringtime, commissionedThe Stormafter having seenSpringtimein her cousin’s Manhattan mansion, where he had given it pride of place.Caught in the midst of a sudden autumn storm, a young couple rushes to find shelter, temporarily shielding themselves from the imminent onrush with a deep mustard-toned fabric with a dramatic reflective sheen quite possibly deriving from the light of the moon. The leaves on the plants by their feet are browning, which confirms the season for their flight. The makeshift fabric umbrella picks up the reddish tones of the girl’s hair. While Cot might have initially sought out the same models seven years afterSpringtime, he seems to have used different models in the end. However, as in the earlier scene, both figures are barefoot and both have curly locks. Dressed only in transparent drapery in each painting, the girl’s nubile body becomes the star of the show. The boy is in classical garb in both pictures, too; here, a kind of loincloth accessorized with a shepherd’s horn. Instead of swinging on a sunny spring day, the pair inThe Stormrush under a makeshift umbrella from a thunderstorm with an ominously dark sky and a bolt of lightning at top right. In subject and style, both paintings owe their origins to Cot’s teachers Bouguereau and Cabanel, who embraced genre scenes and mythological subjects with tidbits of titillation.Critics at the Salon of 1880, where Cot first exhibitedThe Storm, were less taken with the picture than the public. Philippe de Chennevières (1880) found it banal, something apart from true art. Similarly, René Delorme (1880) called it a triumph of conventionality and noted that the figures resembled porcelain enamel (most likely referring to their lack of expression). More humorous reactions to it included that of Vast-Ricouard and Gros-Kost (1880), who joked that if the girl were to have encountered a policeman, he would have reported her for running through the fields so academically dressed (\"aussi académiquement habillée\") in her transparent raincoat. Maurice de Seigneur (1880) responded to the inevitable question of where the couple was headed by stating that they were running after bourgeois success (\"après le succès bourgeois\"), likely a comment about Cot’s own attempt to rekindle his success with bourgeois audiences in the wake ofSpringtime’s popularity.Commentators at the Salon of 1880 found literary sources for the subject in Bernardin de Saint-Pierre’s (1737–1814) popular French Romantic novelPaul et Virginie(first published in 1788) and the ancient Greek writer Longus’sDaphnis and Chloe(see especially Delorme 1880 and Seigneur 1880). Bernardin de Saint-Pierre’s novel tells the story of childhood friends who become lovers. Longus’s fourth-century pastoral tale of another adolescent couple, a shepherd and shepherdess who grew up together, is more overtly erotic. While critics of Cot’s day were unable to determine precisely which literary source inspired the artist, Rubin (1980) stresses that the Romantic novel has more specific relevance to Cot’s pendant images.Paul et Virginie’s inclusion of a scene of teens fleeing a rainstorm, making Virginie’s overskirt into an impromptu shelter from the storm, as well as the novel’s continued popularity in this period (French novelist Gustave Flaubert [1821–1880] named characters after the pair in his 1877 novelUn Coeur simple) give credence to the critics’ identification of this literary source. Delorme (1880) retroactively connected the figures inSpringtimeto the same novel.Rubin (1980) also discusses both pictures in the context of Cot’s conscious catering to popular taste, his \"ingratiation . . . to bourgeois society\" and notes ofThe Stormthat \"it exemplifies not the ideals but rather the taste of the period, to which its creator catered so generously.\" In this manner, Rubin characterizes Cot as a fashionable artist more than a traditional Academician focused on larger ideals to be upheld. These playful images of youth continue to appeal to broad audiences even today.Jane R. Becker 2016",

        "Intro Description": "When Cot exhibited this painting at the Salon of 1880, critics speculated about the source of the subject. Some proposed the French novelPaul and Virginieby Bernardin de Saint-Pierre (1737–1814), in which the teenage protagonists run for shelter in a rainstorm, using the heroine’s overskirt as an impromptu umbrella; others suggested the romanceDaphnis and Chloeby the ancient Greek writer Longus. New York collector and Metropolitan Museum benefactor Catharine Lorillard Wolfe commissioned the work under the guidance of her cousin John Wolfe, one of Cot's principal patrons. Like the artist’s earlierSpringtime(2012.575), it was immensely popular and extensively reproduced.",

        "Date:": "ca. 1656–57",

        "Catalogue Entry": "This picture is possibly Vermeer's first effort in the field to which he devoted nearly all of his mature career: scenes of domestic life, usually focusing on a woman's personal surroundings. It probably dates from 1656 or 1657, followingDiana and Her Companionsof about 1653–54 (Mauritshuis, The Hague),Christ in the House of Mary and Marthaof about 1655 (National Gallery of Scotland, Edinburgh), andThe Procuress, dated 1656 (Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister, Dresden). It is likely one of the earliest works by Vermeer to have been acquired by the contemporary Delft collector Pieter Claesz van Ruijven (1624–1674), who owned all or at least most of the twenty-one paintings by Vermeer sold in the estate sale of his son-in-law, Jacob Dissius, in 1696.It is known from technical examination (see fig. 1 above) that Vermeer made several changes to the picture. An x-radiograph reveals the figure of a man in the rear room, his head coincident with the mirror which, like the table below it, was added at a later stage. The man's face appears to be seen in profile, and two different hats were tried on his head. The larger hat is seen from the front, indicating that at one stage the man was coming toward the viewer. A dog stood by the open door, looking at the male visitor. The still life on the table was also substantially revised (Liedtke 2007). Thus, the implication is not that a visitor is expected, but that one—to judge from the open door and the disorderly array of objects on the table—has recently left the room.The corner of a painting on the wall above the maid shows the leg of a Cupid and a theatrical mask. Similar paintings appear in other works by Vermeer, and may be based on a painting of Cupid (or Amor) listed in the 1676 inventory of the artist's estate. The mask may have been included in The Met's painting to suggest that love is here unmasked.[2010; adapted from Liedtke 2007]",

        "Intro Description": "The misbehavior of unsupervised maidservants was a common subject for seventeenth-century Dutch painters. Yet in his depiction of a young maid dozing next to a glass of wine, Vermeer transfigured an ordinary scene into an investigation of light, color, and texture that supersedes any moralizing lesson. While the toppled glass at left (now abraded with time) and rumpled table carpet may indicate a recently departed visitor, X-radiographs indicate that Vermeer chose to remove a male figure he had originally included standing in the door­way, heightening the painting’s ambiguity.",

The text refers to a brief (and illusory) respite from war, but Puvis portrays untroubled repose after harvesting. By depicting sleepers of all ages, ranging from an old man to a mother cradling her baby, the artist creates an image of communal rest and protection.",

        "Object Number:": "2011.26",
        "Catalogue Entry": "ThisHoly Family with the Young Saint John the Baptistwas unknown prior to its sale in Genoa, Italy in 2009 and was first published in full in 2011 (Wolk-Simon, Gallagher). It is a relatively early work by Perino del Vaga and seems to date from the mid-1520s, when the artist worked for the papal court and members of the Curial elite, rising to become the leading mural painter in the competitive Roman art world. It is closest in date to Perino’s fresco of thePietàin S. Stefano del Cacco, Rome (ca. 1524–26; see fig. 1 above), where the Virgin wears a similar traditional mantle and the figure holding the nails behind the group (Nicodemus?), shares Joseph’s somewhat ambiguous and haunting character. A private devotional image, it is an exceedingly rare example of this aspect of the artist’s activity, which principally involved designing and executing frescoes, stucco reliefs, tapestries, and decorative objects, as well as the occasional altarpiece. Only five or six such compositions of this type by him are known today; that closest in date may be the unfinishedHoly Family with Saint John the Baptistnow in the Courtauld Gallery, London.Together with Parmigianino, Pontormo, and Rosso Fiorentino, Perino del Vaga is one of the foremost exponents of Italian Mannerism. A member of Raphael’s workshop and later court artist to Admiral-Prince Andrea Doria in Genoa and then to Pope Paul III Farnese, he was the single most influential painter and draftsman in Rome in the decades following Raphael’s death in 1520; his formulation of a graceful, elegant, and refined idiom—an artistic style that fluidly synthesized elements of the art of Raphael, Michelangelo, and the antique—became the paradigm emulated by generations of painters in the Eternal City (many of whom were members of his workshop in the 1540s).On the shoulder of the Virgin is a gold star, indicating the Virgin’s status as thestella maris(star of the sea), a title emphasizing Mary’s role as a guiding star for Christians. The goldfinch held by the Christ Child is a common symbol for his passion, while the cherry he takes from his mother refers to the Fall of Man, brought about by the forbidden fruit, a sin to be redeemed by Christ’s death. The young Saint John the Baptist wears a crown of vine leaves and a leopard-skin robe, attributes of Bacchus. This conflation of the two figures was current in early sixteenth-century Florence, where Bacchus was understood as a precursor to the Baptist (see S. J. Freedberg, \"A Recovered Work of Andrea del Sarto with some Notes on a Leonardesque Connection,\"Burlington Magazine124 [May 1982], pp. 281–88; and Marilyn Aronberg Lavin, \"Andrea del Sarto's 'St. John the Baptist',\"Burlington Magazine125 [March 1983], p. 162). Because this iconography is particular to Florence, it is likely that Perino’s patron was a Florentine living in Rome.The early history of the painting is unknown, but it may be the \"quadro di un Madonna con Christarello et San Giovanni et San Giuseppe in tavola mano di Pierino del Vaga con cornice tutta indorata,\" listed in the 1624 inventory of Costanzo Patrizi in Rome (published in Anna Maria Pedrocchi,Le stanze del tesoriere, Milan, [2000], p. 389). It was sold in 2009 from the Palazzo Ricci Petrocchini in the town of Pollenza, outside Macerata (Marches), built by the Counter-Reformation prelate Cardinal Gregorio Petrocchini da Montelparo (1537–1612). This was a historical collection of some significance, but it is not known when theHoly Familyentered their possession.Andrea Bayer 2011",
        "Technical Notes": "At the time of its acquisition, and despite its evident quality, Perino del Vaga’sHoly Family with the Infant Saint John the Baptistwas severely affected by a thick layer of oxidized, discolored varnish, surface grime, and nicotine (see fig. 2 above). These coatings swamped the rich coloring of the painting and undermined its subtle tonal transitions. More seriously, the Virgin’s aqua-blue veil had been entirely overpainted at a later date by another hand. This overpaint comprised a mixture of the blue pigments azurite and smalt, which suggests that the aim was to impose a more traditional coloring in this area of the composition. However, over the years the overpaint had discolored to the point of becoming dark and formless. It had been crudely painted up to and around the fine filigree lines of gold that describe thestella marisand decorative edges of the veil.To help clarify the condition of the original painting beneath the obscuring layer of overpaint, an x-radiograph (fig. 3) was made, revealing an intact and elaborate set of folds in the Virgin’s drapery. The dark horizontal lines visible in the x-radiograph indicate where channels were cut into the reverse of the wood panel during its construction, which allowed for tapered cross-battens to be slid in, helping to stabilize the support.Photographs taken while the discolored varnish and overpaint were in the process of being removed show some minor losses, scratches, and stains, but overall, the condition of the original is exceptionally good (fig. 4). The old varnish is still in place over the hand of the Virgin and the lower portion of the Christ Child, obscuring the modeling and rosy coloring of the flesh tones. A large part of the overpaint has already been removed from the Virgin’s drapery—a slow process that has been accomplished mostly with a scalpel used under high magnification. Even at this early stage, the impact of the removal is clear: the head of the Infant Baptist is thrown into relief, and the powerfully expressive role of light and shadow in the construction of the composition is revealed.The surface of the thick poplar panel that serves as the painting’s support was prepared with a traditional gesso ground (calcium sulphate bound in animal glue). The artist made very few changes to the composition during the course of execution, adjusting only the contour of the Christ Child’s head and leg. This strongly suggests the use of a full-size preparatory drawing, which would have been transferred to the prepared panel before painting. Such transfers were usually achieved by painstakingly pricking the lines of the drawing and then pressing or brushing a medium through the holes, leaving a dotted outline of the design on the surface to be painted. This method of transfer, a process known as pouncing, was typical in Raphael’s workshop and frequently adopted by his assistants. Pouncing marks made with a carbon-based medium such as charcoal can be imaged using infrared reflectography, but no such marks were uncovered in theHoly Family. Nevertheless, lines of tiny losses (revealing a dark underlayer) indicate that pouncing was indeed used to transfer a preexisting design (fig. 5). The material employed was not carbon-based and appears to have caused the overlying paint to splinter away—an interesting and unusual phenomenon.Michael Gallagher 2011",

        "Intro Description": "Florentine by birth, Perino was trained in Raphael’s workshop in Rome, where he soon became one of the most inventive artists of his generation. This is a rare, early devotional painting. It includes traditional symbols such as the goldfinch (symbolic of the Resurrection), but also more unusual details, especially a young Saint John the Baptist who is crowned with grape leaves and wears a leopard skin, attributes of the pagan god Bacchus who, like John, was associated with rebirth. The care that Perino invested in this panel is especially evident in the vivid features of the infant Christ, which may derive from his study of an actual child.",

        "Catalogue Entry": "These two scenes from the life of Telemachus, son of Odysseus, are based on the novelThe Adventures of Telemachus, published by the influential French theologian and political theorist François Fénelon in 1699, and popular throughout Europe during the eighteenth century. Telemachus, guided by Athena in the guise of Mentor, was shipwrecked off Calypso’s island while searching for his father. In the first scene (25.110.188), Calypso's nymphs gather around Telemachus, offering him fruit, wine, and a garland of flowers. At left the elderly, bearded Mentor is led away by Calypso herself. In the second (25.110.187), Calypso silences the nymphs who have been singing Odysseus’s praises when she sees the sadness of his son.Kauffmann describes the pictures in herMemoria delle piture(Knight 1998) and records that they were commissioned by Monsignor Onorato Caetani. The first entry is dated Naples 1782 and the second Rome 1783. Both compositions are friezes, with similarly constructed backgrounds; the prices and sizes are identical; they must have been intended as pendants.Caetani—apostolic protonotary, savant, and writer—belonged to an ancient and noble Roman family and was a younger son. He commissioned portraits of himself from Anton Raphael Mengs in 1779, from Pompeo Batoni in 1782, and from Kauffmann in 1783. Later that year, Kauffmann was working on four large oval canvases representing allegorical figures for Caetani; these were completed in January 1784, when she submitted her bill of 858 Neapolitan ducats for five of the six works, including the two catalogued here. Nine months later, she accepted what proved to be a final commission from this collector, for a portrait of the duchessa di Corigliano with her son and his nurse (location unknown).A smaller version of the Museum'sSorrow of Telemachus, with a somewhat different background (Vienna art market, 1998), had as a pendantBacchus Teaching the Nymphs to Make Verses(location unknown), which Kauffmann was working on in August 1787. A larger, signed version (Bündner Kunstmuseum Chur, Switzerland), painted in 1788, had as a pendantThe Departure of Adonis for the Hunt(private collection, France).[2010; adapted from Baetjer 2009]",

        "Intro Description": "Kauffmann was born in Switzerland but made her reputation in Italy and England, where she was a founding member of the Royal Academy. These companion paintings were executed in Rome for Monsignor Onorato Caetani, who in the same year had his portrait painted by Kauffmann. Later portraits of him by Anton Raphael Mengs and Pompeo Batoni attest to the tight‑knit, international character of eighteenth‑century Roman intellectual circles. Kauffmann was among Europe’s most sought-after history painters. These compositions were based on François Fénelon’sThe Adventures of Telemachus(1699), in which the son of the Greek hero Odysseus washes up on the shores of an island inhabited by Calypso and her nymphs.",

        "Catalogue Entry": "This colorful canvas represents a river at sunset, with boats, cows, and travelers enlivening the landscape. A village with a church appears on the left, while farmhouses and a tower are visible in the right background. A sailboat full of people and a barge full of cows move over the still surface of the water. The dead tree on the right frames the view and carries the eye up to the brilliantly colored clouds. In this wide panorama, the river seems not only to recede but also to flow forward and out of the composition to the right. As in similar works by the artist, the picture includes motifs that bring the eye back to the center, to the gently curved horizon, and to the frequent discovery of picturesque or painterly effects.Van der Neer's optical interests are strikingly evident in the sky and less assertively so in the water. The dark vertical strokes next to the boat by the shoreline, the reflections by the boats on the right, and the transition from a shadowy to a shiny surface in the river are instances of Van der Neer's understated sensitivity to observed and aesthetic effects.As Schulz (2002) maintains, these qualities support a later dating than that suggested in earlier literature. Van der Neer's sunset scenes and other landscapes of the 1640s are by comparison almost naive in their treatment of light, space, and certain motifs, such as trees. The standardized foliage of the trees to the left in The Met's picture also occurs in paintings by the artist dating from midcentury, but these works already reveal the special interest in light effects that comes to fruition here. River views of approximately this composition are common in the early 1650s and often feature beautiful skies. A variety of stylistic considerations inclined Liedtke (2007) to favor a dating in the 1650s rather than the early 1660s, as Schulz tentatively suggests.A drawing in the Albertina, Vienna, corresponds closely in design if not motifs to the left three-quarters of this composition. The sheet may be regarded as another invention of the 1650s that demonstrates Van der Neer's gift for recycling ideas.[2017; adapted from Liedtke 2007]",

        "Intro Description": "A keen eye for effects of light distinguishes the landscape paintings of Aert van der Neer. Here, the artist turned his attention to the sun setting over a river, with brilliantly illuminated pink and yellow clouds casting their reflections onto the water below. In the foreground, wayfarers of various social classes move along a serpentine road that draws the eye back toward a village in the distance. In its coloration and anecdotal detail, the painting reveals Van der Neer’s awareness of landscapes by such Flemish contemporaries as Jan Brueghel the Elder and Peter Paul Rubens.",

        "Notes": "Courbet is thought to have painted this work in reponse toLa Source(1856, Musée d'Orsay, Paris), by Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres. Ingres's painting, which depicts a hyper-idealized nude holding a jar from which water pours as an allusion to spring or a river source, was completed in 1856 and first exhibited at the Paris Salon that year. In 1857 the picture was sold comte Duchâtel, who lent it to an exhibition held at the Galerie Martinet, Paris, in 1861.",
        "Intro Description": "Rejecting the convention of showing an idealized, statuesque female figure based on classical models, in this work Courbet dropped the trappings of an academic allegory or, indeed, of a picture with a high-minded pretext. His picture of a woman embracing a cascade of water may have been a response to a work by Ingres exhibited in Paris the previous year, which depicts a hyper-idealized nude holding a jar from which water pours as an allusion to spring or a river source.",

At far right the artist depicted the edge of another canvas—a conceit recalling the work of seventeenth-century master and fellow countryman Velázquez. The present picture hung prominently in Sorolla’s wildly successful 1909 exhibition at the Hispanic Society of America in New York, where The Met immediately acquired it.",

        "Catalogue Entry": "Between 1890 and 1892, Gérôme made both painted and sculpted variations on the theme of Pygmalion and Galatea, the tale recounted in Ovid’sMetamorphoses(Book X, lines 243–97). All depict the moment when the sculpture of Galatea was brought to life by the goddess Venus, in fulfillment of Pygmalion’s wish for a wife as beautiful as the sculpture he created. Gérôme’s correspondence with his biographer Fanny Field Hering (see References) provides information about the origins of the present work. In 1890, the artist remarked that he had begun painting the subject, which he thought very hackneyed, in an attempt to rejuvenate it. In November 1890, he mentionedPygmalion and Galateaamong several works that he had painted the prior summer, which were nearly finished.In January 1891, Gérôme wrote to Hering that he would soon sculpt a marble version of this subject; it has been suggested that he based the marble sculpture on a plaster original that had served as the model for the earlier painted versions (Ackerman 1986, 2000). Gérôme sold the present work to his dealer Boussod, Valadon on March 22, 1892; the firm sold it to Chicago collector Charles Tyson Yerkes early the following month, on April 7. The marble (Hearst Castle, San Simeon, California) was completed in 1892 and exhibited at the Paris Salon that year; originally polychromed, it has lost its color.In each of the paintings, the sculpture appears at a different angle, as though it were being viewed in the round. There are two known painted versions of this subject showing Galatea frontally (both in private collections; Ackerman 2000, nos. 388 and 388.2, as 1890). A third version shows Galatea at a diagonal (presumed lost; Ackerman no. 386, as ca. 1892). A fourth version, identifiable in a photograph of Gérôme's studio, has been described as representing Galatea \"seen fullyen face\" (presumed lost; Ackerman no. 387, as ca. 1892). Gérôme also painted a \"reduction\" of the present composition (whereabouts unknown), which he sold to Boussod, Valadon on May 5, 1892, two months after The Met's painting; they sold it to the Czar of Russia on September 24, 1892 (dealer stock no. 22251; see Lafont-Couturier 2000; not in Ackerman).The Met's painting appears on the back wall of Gérôme's studio inThe Artist's Model(1892; Haggin Museum, Stockton, California; Ackerman no. 419). A later version ofThe Artist's Model(1895; Dahesh Museum of Art, New York; Ackerman no. 419.3) shows a different version ofPygmalion and Galatea(Ackerman no. 388) in the background.Asher Ethan Miller 2016",

        "Intro Description": "Between 1890 and 1892, Gérôme made both painted and sculpted variations on the theme of Pygmalion and Galatea, the tale recounted in Ovid’sMetamorphoses. All depict the moment when the sculpture of Galatea was brought to life by the goddess Venus, in fulfillment of Pygmalion’s wish for a wife as beautiful as the sculpture he created. This is one of three known versions in oil that are closely related to a polychrome marble sculpture, also fashioned by Gérôme (Hearst Castle, San Simeon, Calif.). In each of the paintings, the sculpture appears at a different angle, as though it were being viewed in the round.",

        "Notes": "This small oil sketch andA Man Mounting a Horse(49.145.2) are rarely discussed in the Van Dyck literature, but Jaffé 1960, Millar 1964, and Held 1983 have defended the old attribution to Van Dyck. His authorship is supported by the examination of a number of oil sketches and drawings of certain attribution that contain horses (see Liedtke 1984). These sketches may have been made with an equestrian portrait of a prince or commander in mind. The depiction of a model, rather than the actual sitter for the finished painting, in compositional sketches such as these, conforms to the usual practice of Van Dyck and Rubens.",
        "Intro Description": "These small oil sketches by Van Dyck were probably painted around 1630. They derive from similar studies by Rubens, and would have been used in Van Dyck's studio as models for equestrian portraits or historical and religious pictures.",

        "Catalogue Entry": "In 1658, Fabritius was thirty-four years old and living in Leiden with his family. He had probably been painting since his mid-teens, but no works dating from before about 1650 are known. One of the earliest, a canvas in the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, depicts the same subject as this one, which was exceedingly popular in Rembrandt's circle and with Protestant collectors. For further discussion of the theme, see Nicolaes Maes'sAbraham Dismissing Hagar and Ishmael(1971.73).In his previous treatment of the scene (Gen. 21:14), Fabritius was influenced by Rembrandt but more obviously based his composition on a painting of 1612 (Kunsthalle, Hamburg) by Rembrandt's teacher, Pieter Lastman (1583–1633). In several works that date or may be dated between the San Francisco canvas, of about 1650, and The Met's work, Fabritius clearly benefited from the influence of his brother Carel (1622–1654), adding effects of texture, daylight, and shadow to domestic settings. In the New York painting, by contrast, the artist appears to have returned to a manner more exclusively of the Rembrandt school in the 1650s, which is not unexpected for an artist working in Leiden and no doubt looking to Amsterdam for inspiration, as he had before. Carel Fabritius's example resulted in a Delft-like interlude in his brother's work, during which he painted several of his best pictures. Two or three years after Carel's death, however, Barent's style became more similar to that of Maes, Gerbrand van den Eeckhout, and other Rembrandt pupils who first flourished in the 1640s or early 1650s.Although the painting is a comparatively minor work by Fabritius, it should be said that reproductions do not do it justice. In the brown tones that dominate in the wooded landscape and in the garments, the fall of light and the use of local color concentrate the dramatic moment. The bold red of Abraham's jacket below his tan cloak is echoed in the clothing of his son. Hagar is heavily dressed in muted greens and whites, with a brick red coat circling her waist. A straw hat is tied at the back, and is awkwardly juxtaposed with a farmhouse in the distance. The trees and green hill in the background suggest that Hagar and Ishmael are being banished to Westphalia rather than to a wilderness in the Middle East.Comparison with other biblical pictures by the artist assures one that this rather sentimental staging of the subject is entirely sincere. Abraham, at the age of one hundred, still has the physical and emotional strength to give Hagar a gentle shove and to point out her path. The manner in which she slumps in despair on his shoulder, with hands clasped together, is affecting and likely original to Fabritius. Ishmael's expression seems inconsistent with the mood of his parents and no match for what the young Maes achieved. It seems likely that Fabritius meant to suggest bravery and trust. In his right hand the boy holds onto the cord of Hagar's gourd filled with water (shoes and a knife also hang from her waist). His bow and quiver of arrows, conspicuously displayed, remind us that the future founder of the Ishmaelites would grow strong hunting in the wild.[2016; adapted from Liedtke 2007]",

        "Catalogue Entry": "Wtewael is known especially for his small paintings on copper, among which this spectacular picture of 1605 is one of the finest examples in terms of conception, execution, and state of preservation. The work first came to light in the 1980s. Previously no painting by Wtewael of this subject was known, although there are three references to such a picture, or to more than one, in old inventories. There is strong circumstantial evidence that this work is identical with the one cited in the 1619 inventory of the imperial Kunstkammer in Vienna (Lowenthal 1997), which would mean that the painting was probably acquired not long after it was made, by one of the greatest collectors in Europe, Emperor Rudolf II, in Prague.The theme of the Golden Age (Aetas aurea) was taken from the opening pages of theMetamorphoses, by the Roman poet Ovid (43 B.C.–A.D. 18), which was the primary source of mythological subjects in Netherlandish art from the late sixteenth century onward. The relevant passage (1.89–112) follows the first eighty-eight lines describing the creation of heaven and earth, water and air, animals and mankind: \"In the beginning was the Golden Age, when men of their own accord, without threat of punishment, without laws, maintained good faith and did what was right . . . \"For the most part, Wtewael based his interpretation on Ovid's text, but he also must have admired the treatment of the theme by his Utrecht colleague Abraham Bloemaert (1566–1651) in a masterful drawing of 1603 (Städelsches Kunstinstitut, Frankfurt), and the superb print after it, dated 1604, by the Antwerp engraver Nicolaes de Bruyn (1571–1656). In fact, Bloemaert's composition, by far the most impressive version of the story by a Netherlandish artist up to that time, probably inspired Wtewael's turn to the subject in the first place.This work is a quintessential cabinet picture in its extraordinary refinement of execution, its classical theme, its references to other works of art, and its minute study of naturalistic details, in particular the various shells—themselves collector's items—which suggest (unlike the trees) that the mythological paradise was to be found somwhere in the East Indian Ocean. In every respect, the painting seems the perfect Rudolfine image, given the emperor's love of erotic mythologies, forest scenes, naturalia, and precious works of art. It is also probable that Rudolf II would have recognized parallels between the Golden Age and his own reign. Wtewael would have been familiar with this sort of analogy, since Ovid's description of the Golden Age had just been presented as a metaphor for beneficent rulership in Karel van Mander'sSchilder-Boek, published in 1604.Two drawings by Wtewael appear to represent initial and nearly final stages in his development of this composition. The earlier drawing (Staatliche Graphische Sammlung, Munich), usually described as unfinished, is mainly concerned with a scheme for framing the view, with naked couples, gnarled tree trunks, and Cupid-like children sinuously bracketing the sides of the composition, and in the center the motif of one boy helping another to mount an agreeable goat. The second drawing (Kupferstich-Kabinett, Dresden) is quite dissimilar, and very close in design to the painting.A large, crude copy, apparently dating from the seventeenth century but not close to the work of Joachim or Peter Wtewael, was on the German art market in the early 1980s.[2012; adapted from Liedtke 2007]",

        "Intro Description": "Bourdon was one of Nicolas Poussin’s most ardent early followers, and he often went to great lengths to display familiarity with the classical references Poussin had pioneered for painting. In this rigorously structured landscape, Bourdon quoted ancient and contemporary works of classical art: the large statue of a horse at the left directly cites a statue found on Rome’s Quirinal Hill, while the group of dancers at the right comes from Poussin’sBacchanal(ca. 1632–33; National Gallery, London).",
