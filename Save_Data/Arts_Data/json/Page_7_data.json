        "Intro Description": "This is the only private devotional painting of the Madonna and Child known by Caravaggio. It dates from the early 1600s when Caravaggio was increasingly attentive to the work of his great contemporary Annibale Carracci, whose work in Rome follows the classical tradition of Raphael. The clarity of light and form was important to these painters. This canvas was probably sent to France soon after its execution, which may explain why it is not mentioned by any of Caravaggio’s early biographers.",

        "Notes": "Alfred Dedreux (1810–1860), who would later become known as a painter of racing and hunting scenes, was the son of the architect Pierre-Anne Dedreux (1789–1874), and the nephew of the painter Pierre-Joseph Dedreux-Dorcy (1789–1849), both friends of Gericault. The sitter was identified on the basis of his resemblance to a double portrait by Gericault of Alfred Dedreux with his sister (formerly Becq de Fouquières collection; sold, Hôtel Drouot, Paris, May 8, 1925, no. 24; in 2006 collection of Pierre Bergé and Yves Saint-Laurent, Paris). See Mosby 1983 for a different theory concerning the identity of the little girl. In The Met's portrait the little boy appears to be between eight and ten years old, which would place the picture about 1818–1820, a dating that accords with the style in which it was painted.A bust-length portrait by Gericault of a child, probably Alfred Dedreux, was loaned to an exhibition in Rome in 1979–80 by Robert Lebel, Paris.The pendant to this portrait depicts the sitter's sister Elisabeth Dedreux in the Roman countryside (private collection). An x-ray of the pendant revealed that it was painted over an image of the head of Alfred Dedreux.",
        "Intro Description": "The subject of this portrait is the nephew of Gericault’s friend the painter Pierre-Joseph Dedreux-Dorcy. This canvas is one of a small group of drawings and paintings (in various collections) that depict the eight- or nine-year-old Alfred and his younger sister, Elisabeth, with remarkable self-possession and grace for their age. Alfred became a painter and, like Gericault, was enamored of horses. Eugène Delacroix, who had studied with Gericault, later owned this painting.",

        "Catalogue Entry": "Stoskopff was an Alsatian still-life painter born and raised in the independent Protestant republic of Strasbourg. In 1615, he became the pupil of the painter and architect Daniel Soreau (died 1619) in Hanau, near Frankfurt am Main. From 1621 until 1640 he lived in Paris, resettling in Strasbourg in 1641.Stoskopff's finest paintings date from his Paris period. In its simplicity and allusive combination of seemingly unrelated objects, the present canvas is an unusually good example of Stoskopff’s most French-inspired work. Before a plain black background are arranged three objects: a chip-wood box, with its lid askew, a polished nautilus shell (Nautilus pompilius), and a humpback cowrie shell (Cypraea mauritiana). The box was common in this period and appears frequently in still lifes of the seventeenth century. The shells, coming from the Indian and Pacific oceans, were collector’s items. As costly objects, with their sheen of mother-of-pearl, they could be seen as symbols of vanity. Stoskopff’s preoccupation with light is paramount: objects seem mysteriously to hold and transmit it.The picture, neither signed nor dated, was probably painted in the late 1620s. It is more sophisticated than the two dated works of 1625, theStill Life with a Candle and Books(Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen, Rotterdam) and theStill Life with a Baguette and Fish(private collection, Paris), and not yet touched by Stoskopff’s later striving for grandeur, as seen in theFive Sensesof 1633 (Musée des Beaux-Arts, Strasbourg).[2016; adapted from Fahy 2005]",

        "Intro Description": "This enigmatic portrait is difficult to place geographically and has few, if any, stylistic parallels. It was previously attributed to the Lombard school, largely because of its Italian pure profile format, but its technique appears to be Northern European. In the 1520s such portraits became fashionable in Augsburg, where the Imperial Habsburg court had close ties with Lombardy, and an attribution of the present work to a painter in that town seems most prudent.",

        "Catalogue Entry": "The Artist:Duccio is the key figure of Sienese painting and together with Giotto one of the great innovators of Italian art.The next generation of painters in Siena—Segna di Bonaventura, Ugolino di Nerio, Simone Martini, and Pietro Lorenzetti—all probably spent time in his workshop (The Met owns examples by each) and it is to Duccio that Sienese painting owes its particular character: a refined sense of color combined with an emphasis on a delicately calibrated expressivity. Duccio remained more attached to Byzantine models than his Florentine contemporaries, but he was also open to the influence of French ivories—highly prized at the time. The elegant refinement of his paintings together with his more discursive approach to narrative the tender emotional world he explored give him a special place. The fact that he and his closest follower, Ugolino di Nerio, received major commissions in Florence testify to the prestige his art enjoyed. His early work shows close affinities with that of Cimabue, but in his exploration of space he left the Florentine far behind. Whereas Giotto's space is always rigorously rational and serves to underscore the figurative content, Duccio's has a more emotional character and is sometimes audaciously expansive (see, for example, theTemptation of Christin the Frick Collection, New York). Such was his reputation in 1285 that he received one of the most important commissions in late thirteenth-century Florence: the so-calledRucellai Madonna(an enormous panel of the Madonna and Child enthroned now in the Uffizi, Florence). His double-sided altarpiece for the cathedral of Siena—theMaestà—is a landmark in the history of western art and includes on the reverse side numerous narrative scenes of the life of Christ of inexhaustible inventiveness.The Picture:The picture in The Met is a small, devotional panel of exquisite facture. In it, the Madonna is shown exchanging glances with her infant son, who reaches one hand up to push aside her veil. They are shown behind a parapet—one of the earliest appearances of this device marking the boundary between the timeless, sacred world of the Virgin and that inhabited by the viewer/worshipper. The picture first came to public attention at the landmark exhibition of Sienese art held at the Palazzo Pubblico in Siena in 1904 (see Logan 1904, Perkins 1904). Its provenance is unknown prior to its acquisition by Count Gregori Stroganoff (1829–1910), a Russian expatriate who amassed a notable collection of antiquities in Rome in the latter part of the nineteenth century. Subsequently the painting entered the celebrated collection of the Belgian banker and industrialist Adolphe Stoclet (1871–1949), and remained with his heirs until acquired by The Met in 2004. The picture, in its original, engaged frame, was an independent object and did not form part of a diptych: x-rays reveal no sign of hinges, but a damage at the top of the reverse side of the panel is evidence of a hanging device. The two blackened areas along the bottom of the frame are burns, presumably from candles lit below the picture.Iconographic Novelties:The most novel feature of the painting is the illusionistic parapet, based on the fictive architectural surrounds of the frescoes of the life of Saint Francis in the Basilica of San Francesco, Assisi, a cycle that dates to the years of the papacy of Nicholas IV (1288–92). The parapet displays an obvious interest in pictorial space as a means of relating the fictional, sacred realm of the painting to the world of the viewer/worshipper and eliciting from him or her an empathetic response. It is not known when Duccio visited Assisi, but since it was one of the most frequented pilgrimage places in Italy as well as a unique site of artistic innovation and exchange, he may have visited it on more than one occasion. Moreover, for the nearby city of Perugia Duccio painted an altarpiece, of which only the central panel survives (Galleria Nazionale, Perugia). No less important is the emphasis Duccio places on touch: the child's grasp of his mother's veil, her left index finger bent under a fold of his robe, and the way Christ's right foot gently makes contact with his mother's wrist and sleeve. French ivories probably inspired the motif of the Child grasping his Mother's veil and perhaps also the free-hanging veil that falls in elegant folds. Such details confer a tactile quality on the painting that further responds to the emphasis in thirteenth-century devotional practice on experiencing sacred figures as real. By establishing a new spatial and physical relationship with the viewer, Duccio's picture encourages precisely this kind of mental attitude.The Date:There is still no consensus on the precise chronology and attribution of Duccio's paintings. His only two securely dated works are theRucellai Madonna(Galleria degli Uffizi, Florence), commissioned in 1285, and theMaestàfor Siena cathedral, documented to 1308–11. This leaves more than twenty years of activity without a single certainly documented work. Moreover, both theRucellai Madonnaand theMaestàare large, formal, public commissions, quite different in character from Duccio's exquisitely intimate paintings for private devotion. Despite this situation, there has developed a consensus that the work closest to The Met's painting in style, figure type, and spatial interests is the PerugiaMadonna and Child. The Met's and Perugia paintings, together with the triptych of theMadonna and Child with Saints Dominic and Aurea(National Gallery, London), and what is probably a companion triptych at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, all suggest a pivotal moment in Duccio's career: one that lays the groundwork for the great achievement in the narrative panels of theMaestà. Given the very sparse visual and documentary evidence we have, The Met's picture, which seems to be the earliest in the group and the one in which the echoes of Assisi are most clear, can only be dated broadly to the decade ca. 1295–1305, although probably closer to the earlier date than to the later.Examination of the panel with infrared reflectography has revealed a fine underdrawing for the drapery of the Virgin (see fig. 1 above).Keith Christiansen 2012",

        "Frame": "The original engaged frame is from Siena and dates to about 1290 (see figs. 2–4 above). This extraordinary artifact is made of poplar with mitred corner construction. Though severely degraded it retains its original burnished water gilding on a dark red bole and gesso ground. The molding profile characterized by a chamfered sight edge and double hollow within a flat fillet at the top edge is based on architectural stone profiles. The frame furthers the illusion of the parapet incorporated in the painted panel. Singed burns in the wood at the base attest to the devotional history of the object.Timothy Newbery with Cynthia Moyer 2017; further information on this frame can be found in the Department of European Paintings files",
        "Notes": "See De Marchi 2001 for illustrations of five forgeries after this painting, none of which include the illusionistic parapet that appears along the bottom of the original. One of these forgeries is now in the Museum's collection (2005.476.1).The center panel of a polyptych attributed to Ugolino di Nerio (ca. 1315–17; Cleveland Museum of Art) depicts a Madonna and Child that is quite close to The Met's work. Ugolino is presumed to have been a pupil of Duccio, by whom he was greatly influenced.",
        "Intro Description": "This lyrical work inaugurates the tradition in Italian art of envisioning the Madonna and Child in terms appropriated from real life. The Christ Child gently pushes away the veil of his mother, whose sorrowful expression reflects her foreknowledge of his crucifixion. The parapet connects the fictive, sacred world of the painting with the temporal one of the viewer. The bottom edge of the original frame is marked by candle burns.",

He translated the half-length narrative compositions of high Baroque painters such as Caravaggio into parodic images of the social classes.

In this characteristic example, an old man tickles a young girl who has fallen asleep with a box of keepsakes on her lap.",

        "Catalogue Entry": "This small, delicately painted panel is a mature example of Van der Neer's ice-skating scenes, and probably dates from about 1660. In this luminous picture, the sun sets over one of Holland's inland waterways. The icy landscape is described mostly in tones of rose and gray. Houses crowd the shoreline at either side. The towers of two village churches mark the recession on the left, which terminates at an overscaled windmill. A small sailboat is moored by the simple, snow-traced crane at the left edge of the composition. A few of the scattered skaters practicecolf, a game resembling golf.The great majority of Van der Neer'swintertjes(little winter scenes), which number more than two hundred, depict figures on a frozen river or canal. These mostly panoramic compositions are structured by receding riverbanks and vertical accents, and in general recall the designs of Hendrick Avercamp (1585–1634) rather than those of the younger painters who were active in the area of Haarlem and Amsterdam. This conservatism is a legacy of Van der Neer's training in his native city of Gorinchem, which did not, however, discourage his describing optical effects such as the sun's reflection, shadows cast by boats, and the sense of light and space infusing cloudy skies. Especially impressive in this picture is the way in which the brilliance of the sunset is diffused throughout the landscape. These qualities may be considered the artist's main concern, whereas predecessors such as Avercamp usually concentrated on the figures. For Van der Neer, humanity seems to represent not so much society as another aspect of nature.Some of the painter's winter scenes of the 1640s are dated, but very few later examples are inscribed with a year. The undated examples are difficult to place chronologically; they reveal a remarkable lack of repetition, and pentimenti suggesting much inventionad libitum. The Met’s picture, however, is consistent in style with a group of small skating scenes that date from the late 1650s and early 1660s.[2017; adapted from Liedtke 2007]",

        "Catalogue Entry": "Rubens had a special talent for depicting mythological lovers, based partly on his profound knowledge of classical literature and sculpture, and on the importance of figure studies, based on live models, to his work in general. He was also exceptionally familiar with paintings by Italian artists who might be described as masters of sensuality, such as Titian, Correggio, Caravaggio, Annibale Carracci, and others.This large canvas was probably painted about 1635–37, presumably as decoration for a large country house, considering that Adonis was a hunter. The picture’s earliest trace, in the collection of the Elector of Bavaria (until 1706), does not discourage the supposition. The composition is broadly inspired by Titian’s painting of the same subject (Museo del Prado, Madrid), which Rubens copied when he stayed in Madrid in 1628–29. The copy, now lost, is listed in the 1640 inventory of Rubens’s estate.Titian has been credited with inventing the so-called leave-taking of Adonis, which in any case was a Renaissance embellishment of the story told in Ovid'sMetamorphoses, X, lines 519 onward. Venus, grazed by one of Cupid’s arrows, falls in love with the handsome Adonis. She takes up his occupation as a hobby, wins his love, and then frets about his confrontations with big game. In Ovid’s account she departs first, in her swan-drawn chariot, but Titian and Rubens have Adonis striding off with manly indifference, toward a fatal encounter with a wild boar.Radiography reveals that the expression of Rubens’s Adonis, in contrast to Titian’s, was originally somber and thus consistent with the Northern European tradition of moralizing Ovid’s tales. In this and in aspects of the composition (especially Venus’s pose) Rubens may have followed an engraving after Crispiin de Passe I, of 1600. But the classical pose of Adonis (recalling the famousHorse Tamersin Rome), Venus’s pillowy charms, Cupid’s precocious wrestling hold, and the muscular ballet that the trio performs are all distinctive of Rubens, whose learning always served his love of humanity.Walter Liedtke 2012",

        "Notes": "This picture was influenced by but not modeled after Titian'sVenus and Adonis(Prado, Madrid), which Rubens copied in Madrid in 1628–29. On the whole, however, Rubens's design, in composition and mood, is more like the engraving after a design by the printmaker Crispijn de Passe I that was published by Hondius in 1600 (see Liedtke 1984, fig. 31). It is likely that Rubens based his Adonis upon some ancient statue or relief of a figure holding a spear, or upon the Dioskouroi (Piazza del Quirinale, Rome).Other versions of this subject by Rubens are known.",
        "Intro Description": "Rubens took the subject of this painting from the Roman poet Ovid’sMetamorphoses. Accidently pricked by one of Cupid’s arrows, Venus fell in love with the handsome hunter Adonis. With cavalier indifference to the goddess’s adoration and her warnings of danger, Adonis hunted a wild boar and was gored to death. Rubens shows their leave-taking—a popular subject also famously depicted by Titian in another picture now at The Met. By adapting subjects explored by earlier artists, Rubens asserted his own status as their worthy successor.",

        "Catalogue Entry": "Murillo's Portraiture:The soft modeling of light and shadow (known as sfumato) and sensitive realism that became synonymous with Murillo’s name were particularly well suited to genre and religious subjects, images of street urchins, the Immaculate Conception and the Virgin and Child (including The Met’s43.13). By contrast, Murillo’s accomplishment as a portraitist has been recognized only recently.[1] This is due in part to the small number of such paintings by or attributed to him, which totals around fifteen examples, two of which are in The Met’s collection. Murillo’s earliest independent portrait seems to be hisJuan Arias de Saavedraof 1650 (Duchess of Cadona collection), a half-length image framed in a rich trompe-l’oeil “stone” cartouche that supplied information about the sitter in the form of an inscription and coat of arms. Murillo would employ this format, which relates closely to print culture and perhaps contemporary stucco work, throughout his career and in his two known self-portraits.[2] In their somber, nearly monochromatic arrangements, stark lighting and broad planes of color, Murillo’s early portraits are not far from works by his older contemporaries, particularly fellow Sevillian Francisco de Zurbarán. During Murillo’s only documented visit to Madrid, in 1658, he would have encountered the conventions of grand portraiture by Titian, Van Dyck and Velázquez’s state portraiture—all of which he incorporated during his later career, particularly in his regal full-length depictions of the Andalusian elite. A rare preparatory pen-and-ink drawing for the full-length portrait of an unknown sitter (65.66.12), dated around 1660, attests to the vitality of Murillo’s creative process in composing images that typically became far more staid in paint. Some of Murillo’s most ambitious portraits were painted shortly after his return to Seville. These include hisPortrait Antonio Hutado de Salcedo, Marquis of Legardo(ca. 1664; Colomer Collection, Madrid) andPortrait of Justino de Neuve(1665; National Gallery, London) on the grounds of which his early biographer, Antonio Palomino, described Murillo as “an eminent portrait painter.”[3] Murillo’s later portraits also incorporated his distinctive soft brushwork. This is evident in The Met’s portrait of Don Andrés de Andrade y La Cal which, when sold from the French King Louis-Philippe’s collection in 1853 prompted theIllustrated London Newsto observe that “The Portraits of Murillo are not numerous, but what exists of them are of great beauty and interest, making one believe that this would have been the field in which he would have been even more preeminently at home than in historical art, had he condescended to adopt it for the field of his operations.”[4]The Painting:When compared with The Met’s earlier full-length portrait by Murillo (54.190), this painting from the later 1660s employs both the artist’s newly found technique of softly modeled shadows and the range of props typical of grand portraiture that he had adopted following a trip to Madrid in 1658.[5] As indicated by the earliest of these, hisPortrait of Inigo Melchor Fernández de Velasco(1659; Musée du Louvre, Paris; see fig. 1 above), the court portraiture of Velázquez, Rubens, and Van Dyck provided a new vocabulary, most importantly the rhetorical role of drapery, classical balustrades and pilasters, in elevating the sitter’s status—indeed, back in Seville, Murillo frequently employed these devices somewhat unconventionally across a wider spectrum of society.Andrade is dressed in the simple black costume typical of male fashion among thehildagoor Spanish noble class, with elegantly slashed sleeves and agolilla, a severely horizontal, white collar. A sword, carried only by nobility, underscores his status; a hint of black lace along the edge of his hat and the pattern of white dots revealed through a pierced pattern in his black shoes are the most subdued expressions of indulgence. The sitter’s long hair was fashionable in Spain during the second half of the seventeenth century. For the face, Murillo employs his signature technique of softly modeled shadows, which captures a psychological depth that is typical of Murillo’s most successful portraits, including a comparable work of an unknown sitter, today in the Museo del Prado (fig. 2).The pilaster and balustrade are used by Murillo in several contemporary paintings in order to indicate a generalized, grand setting, but also in the service of a clever conceit that the artist developed in order to integrate and naturalize the sitter’s name and coat of arms. The addition of coats of arms as a kind of stamp, an afterthought atop the picture plane, was standard practice in early modern portraiture (see, for example,25.110.13). But beginning with his earliest portraits, Murillo seems to have been interested in creating trompe l'oeil carvings, derived from his study of surrounds in printed portraits, in order to solve the problem in a more synthetic, naturalized manner. In a sense, Murillo’s artistic innovation that naturalized a convention is comparable to his means of cleverly humanizing his otherworldly religious subjects (see43.13). He would employ the same conceit of “carved” coats of arms and other inscriptions in hisPortrait of Justino de Neve(1665; National Gallery, London) andPortrait of Juan Antonio de Miranda y Ramírez de Vergara(1680; Alba collection, Palacio de Liria, Madrid). In an even more original approach, Murillo’sPortrait of Antonio Hurtado de Salcedo, Marquis of Legarda(ca. 1664; Colomer collection, Madrid) transposes the coat of arms to a stone that appears as a chunk of ruins in the middle ground of the landscape. As Xavier F. Salomon has observed, Murillo’s interest in antique ruins was probably inspired by sites in and near Seville, a city with a healthy antiquarian culture.[6]Perhaps the most idiosyncratic feature of this portrait is the large mastiff seated obediently beneath Andrade’s hand, a symbol combining fidelity, strength and nobility. Murillo likely took this regal pairing from Titian’sPortrait of Emperor Charles V with a Dog(1533; Museo del Prado, Madrid; fig. 3), itself based on a portrait of the monarch by the Austrian court painter Jacob Seigenegger (1532; Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna). Van Dyck, whom Murillo studied in Madrid, also used dogs in his full-length male portraits (for example,89.15.16); Van Dyck’sPortrait of Wolfgang Wilhem, Prince of Pflaz-Neuburg(ca. 1640; Bayerische Staatgemäldesammlugen, Staatsgalerie, Neubeurg) is particularly close to Murillo’s full-length portrait composition.[7] In Madrid, Murillo could have also asborbed Velázquez’s inclusion of less ferocious animals in hunt portraits ofCardinal Infante Ferdinand of Austria with a Gun and Dogof 1632 orPhilip IV in Hunting Dressof 1633–34 (both Museo del Prado, Madrid). While the particular kind of dog is difficult to identify, its musculature and hefty collar are clearly intended to suggest its power. The Italian painter known as Guercino depicted a similar animal in what is assumed to be the likeness of a beloved if intimidating pet with a wide collar, the so-calledAldrovani Dog(ca. 1625; Norton Simon Foundation, Pasadena); however, in Murillo’s portrait, the body type and depiction in profile also leave open the possibility that this is a generalized, even deliberately antiquated animal type such as those found in Antonio Tempesta’s illustrations for the Roman poet Ovid’s Metamorphosis (1608;51.501.3876) or Tempesta’s series ofHunting Scenes(1609;51.501.4081).Nineteenth-century Celebrity:This painting was especially celebrated in nineteenth-century England.[8] The first certain written reference to the portrait is by the English artist David Wilkie (1785–1841) in 1836 when he encountered it on loan from Sir John Brakenbury to an exhibition at the British Institution, London. Wilkie describes “Brakenbury’s Murillo—The Man with the Dog—Is also in the Gallery: this I saw in the linen-draper’s [the art dealer Bravo’s] house in Seville, and the expression of the head strikes me as much now as it did then.  It seems to see you while you look at it.”[9] When Brackenbury sold the painting on August 15, 1837 to King Louis Philippe of France, who was then forming his Galerie Espagnole at the Louvre, the price was said to be over 2,000 pounds. Although the king seems to have actually paid 1,025 pounds, this was still among the most expensive works acquired for Louis-Philippe’s short-lived experiment in anchoring Spanish art in Paris.[10] In 1848, the historian Sir Edmund Head reflected that within Louis-Philippe’s collection, the portrait of Don Andrés de Andrade y la Cal was “the finest of all—equal, indeed, to the portraits of Velazquez,” adding that “it is painful to think that it was ever suffered to leave England and grace the walls of a foreign gallery.”[11] England had, however, its second chance at the work with the highly publicized sale of paintings from the Galerie Espagnole, held in London on May 14, 1853. Prompted by its sale, a reporter forIllustrated London Newsobserved that \"The portrait now in question is very forcible and true in character: in this respect very much after the style of Velasquez; but with more richness of colouring and softness of finish than he bestowed.”[12] As Richard Ford reported of the sale forThe Athenaem, “It was knocked down for 1,020 pounds, amid cheers of the competitors,” selling to Thomas Baring (1799–1873). Ford also gave a probably embellished story of its provenance, suggesting that the Spanish government had tried to ban its export in 1828, but that the production of a copy had allowed for the original to be smuggled to England.[13] By 1854, in Gustav Friedrich Waagen’sTreaures of Art in Great Britain, he praised it as “one of the finest portraits by the master that I know.”[14] It would be inherited through members of the Baring family until 1927, when it was acquired by The Met.An early copy of this portrait was probably acquired in Spain by Sir Arthur Hervey-Aston (1798–1859), Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary at Madrid.  It is first mentioned by Stirling-Maxwell in 1848 at Aston Hall, Cheshire. This copy was mistakenly reattributed to Velázquez when sold in 1867, then to Valdés Leal when in the collection of F. W. Cosens, Lewes, who purchased it in 1875.[15] Another close copy by José Gutiérrez de la Vega (1791–1865) was given by Gutiérrez to the Real Academia de Bellas Artes, Madrid, in 1829, at the moment when Murillo’s original was on the art market and about to leave Spain (fig. 4).The Sitter:Murillo ensured his sitter’s name was made an integral part of this painting.  Using his characteristic trompe l’oeil conceit discussed above, Murillo inscribed the architecture represented in this portrait with the coat of arms of the Andrade family, including the motto “AVE MARIA GRACIA PLENA” (the Latin “Hail Mary Full of Grace”) at the top of the pilaster and, at its base, the sitter’s full name, “D [for Don] ANDRÉ / de Andrade y / la Cal.” Unfortunately, archival research—notably by Marcus Burke and Diego Angulo Iñiguez—has uncovered practically nothing about this man.[16] While his identity remains elusive, a lexical quirk in the extensive nineteenth-century historiography of this painting has long misguided research.[17] In 1848, Head described it as “the full-length picture of Don Andreas de Andrade, with his hand on the head of a large dog: the picture is thence known by the name ‘El Perdriguero.’” Aperdiguero(without Head’s “r”) is a kind of large hunting dog, similar to today’s Spanish Pointer (Perdiguero de Burgos) and the epithet is hardly surprising given this distinctive animal’s prominence in Murillo’s painting. That same year, however, Stirling-Maxwell’sAnnals of the Artists of Spainlisted it as a portrait depicting “Don Andres de Andrade, Pertigero or verger of the Cathedral of Seville with a white dog,” thereby confusing the terms and introducing an error that has persisted into the most recent literature. While correcting this mistake brings us no closer to Andrade’s actual professional status, it brings the sitter in alignment with his iconography. As early as 1923 and in the recent work of Angulo Iñiguez and Cano Rivero, scholars have noted the unlikely combination of a relatively lowly post within the church and the aristocratic attributes of this portrait.[18]David Pullins 2020[1] The fullest treatments are found in Xavier F.

        "Intro Description": "During a trip to Madrid in 1658, Murillo encountered grand, full-length portraiture by Titian, Velázquez, and Anthony van Dyck. Learning from their conventions, he soon adopted elements like the classical architecture and imposing dog seen here. Little is known of Don Andrés de Andrade y la Cal, whose name and coat of arms are “carved” in trompe l’oeil on the pilaster. The dog appears to be an Alano Español, a ferocious Spanish breed with double-edged associations: they embody noble power in works such as Cervantes’s “The Dialogue of the Dogs” (1613), but their use in war against Indigenous populations in the Americas has been part of European visual culture since Theodore de Bry illustrated Bartolomé de la Casas’sBrief Account of the Spanish Destruction of the Indies(1598).",

        "Catalogue Entry": "This small painting dates from about 1627, several years after Poussin's arrival in Rome in 1624. During the 1620s Poussin was particularly drawn to Venetian painting and the influence of Titian is dominant here. The dramatic alternations of light and shade as well as the hills and sky at the right reflect an awareness of Titian'sBacchanal of the Andrians, and the playful swarms of putti must have been inspired by the remarkableWorship of Venus(both works, in the Ludovisi collection, Rome, at the time, are now in the Museo del Prado, Madrid).Poussin produced several related compositions and our picture was long identified with a work recorded in early inventories as in the Filomarino/Duca della Torre collection in Naples, acquired by Cardinal Ascanio Filomarino in 1627. The Filomarino composition, however, known from a drawing by Fragonard and an engraving after it, appeared at Christie's, London, July 11, 2001, as no. 54 (50 x 60 3/4 in.). Other early paintings of this subject are in the Reinhart Collection, Winterthur (34 5/8 x 26 3/8 in.) and in the Staatliche Kunsthalle, Karlsruhe (39 3/8 x 29 1/2 in.).Ruotolo (1982) lists two copies of this painting (Museo di Capodimonte, Naples, and Museo Correale di Sorrento) and what appears to be a third replica was in a private collection, Rome, in 1999.[Mary Sprinson de Jesús 2010]",

        "Loan Restrictions": "This work may not be lent, by terms of its acquisition by The Metropolitan Museum of Art.",
        "Intro Description": "During Poussin’s early years in Rome, he was especially interested in Venetian painting. He studied Titian’s great mythological compositions, notably the Bacchanals, from which he took inspiration for this painting’s fruit-gathering cherubs. The Holy Family sits under an apple tree with a grape vine twisting around it, two symbols Poussin used to layer meaning for a well-trodden subject. As symbols of salvation, apples connect Christ to the first man, Adam. Grapes are associated with the holy communion and the substantiation of wine for Christ’s blood. Originally, the painting’s palette would have been much brighter, but several of its pigments have degraded over time.",

        "Notes": "In 1880 and 1881, Monet painted a number of views of the town of Vétheuil from the nearby Île Saint-Martin in the Seine (W592–95, 678, 679), using both horizontal and vertical formats. The same buildings can be recognized in some of these paintings, which were painted from different points around the small island.In addition to this version (W592), Arthur B. Emmons also at one time owned W678.",
        "Intro Description": "The footpath winding through the poppy field at bottom right points the way toward the church tower at Vétheuil, the village northwest of Paris where Monet set up house in 1878. Although the landscape appears continuous, the artist painted this view from an island in the Seine River; the water is obscured by a stand of poplars. Monet depicted the area around Vétheuil extensively during the summer of 1880, creating a remarkably varied array of scenes. Three other examples may be found in the Metropolitan’s collection.",

        "Catalogue Entry": "According to Genesis (21:14–19), Hagar, Abraham's Egyptian servant, was sent away to the wilderness of Beersheba after giving birth to their son Ishmael. There, running out of water, she put her baby under the shadow of a tree \"and she went, and sat down apart from him a good way off, as it were a bowshot; for she said, Let me not see the death of the child. And she sat apart from him, and lifted up her voice, and wept.\"  But having heard her voice, God sent an angel who called to Hager and pointed her in the direction of a source of water.Francesco Maffei, a seventeenth-century Venetian artist deeply influenced by the work of Bassano, Tintoretto, and Veronese, painted this subject around 1657, when he left Vicenza for Padua, where he died in 1660. First published by Pallucchini in 1981, the canvas is stylistically close to Maffei's 1657Visitationfor the high altar of the Oratorio dei Proti in Vicenza (Rossi 1991). Maffei depicts Hagar, richly dressed in red and gold brocade, kneeling under two trees, while the baby Ishmael is behind her, in shadow. The statuesque angel appears to her on the right, pointing to the source of water that will save her life. Another painting of the same subject, now in the Castello Sforzesco in Milan (Rossi 1991, p. 94, no. 37), is a later autograph version by Maffei.Rossi, following Pilo's proposal (Giuseppe Maria Pilo,Carpioni, Venice, 1961, p. 38), suggests that Maffei may have based his composition on Giulio Carpioni's engraving of theAgony in the Garden, where the figure of Christ, kneeling in front of two trees, is similar to Hagar in both the Met and Milan paintings.Xavier F.

        "Intro Description": "Maffei lived and worked in the Italian cities of Vicenza and Padua, but was profoundly influenced by Venetian painting. At its most characteristic, his elegant vision veers into the mannered elongated figure types and loose brushwork seen in this painting above the doorway. This scene from the biblical book of Genesis shows the angel appearing to Hagar, an enslaved woman in Egypt. Banished with her infant Ishmael to the desert by her new husband, Abraham, Hagar was allegedly saved by a heavenly creature who directed her to a spring of water.",

        "Notes": "Ronald G. Pisano first noted that a painting by Morisot entitledJeune Femme Assisewas included in an annual exhibition of the Woman’s Art Club of New York, the group founded in 1889, which later changed its name to the National Association of Women Artists (One Hundred Years: A Centennial Celebration of the National Association of Women Artists, exh. cat., Nassau County Museum of Art, Roslyn Harbor, N.Y., 1988, p. 9; and see Donna Gustafson,A Parallel Presence: National Association of Women Artists, 1889–2009, exh. cat., Jane Voorhees Zimmerli Art Museum, The State University of New Jersey, Rutgers, 2009, unpaginated). Pisano mistakenly identified the exhibition in which Morisot participated alongside Mary Cassatt as taking place in 1894. All of the criticism related to this exhibition dates from February 1895. In particular, Walker 1895 and The Art Amateur 1895 clarify not only that it is probable that the Morisot picture included wasYoung Woman Seated on a Sofa, with the sitter attended by roses and a light pink hydrangea, but also that the exhibition took place in 1895, when we know Cassatt’sIn the Loge(1878, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston) to have been included in a Woman’s Art Club exhibition at Klackner’s Gallery as no. 17 (Dans la loge) (see Kevin Sharp and Jonathan Stuhlman in Judith A. Barter, ed.,Mary Cassatt: Modern Woman[Chicago, 1998], pp. 318 [under no. 17], 357). Unfortunately, no copy has been found of the 1895 exhibition catalogue; for the date of the exhibition as February 17, 1895, see Sharp in Barter 1998, p. 357. The archives of Durand-Ruel indicate that ownership of The Met's picture was transferred from the dealer’s Paris branch to the New York branch in January 1895 (see Provenance), but provide no further details about the painting’s precise whereabouts at the time of the exhibition.",
        "Intro Description": "At about the time that Morisot depicted this model in her Paris apartment, an admiring critic wrote: \"she grinds flower petals onto her palette, in order to spread them later on her canvas with airy, witty touches . . . producing something vital, fine, and charming.\" The painter was then at her apogee, having developed a signature style that updated the bravura brushwork of her brother-in-law Edouard Manet with more spirited handling and opalescent tints. She enjoyed a highly successful career, participating in the official Salons and in seven of the eight Impressionist exhibitions.",

        "Notes": "This painting was originally conceived as a half-length portrait of Consuelo Vanderbilt; however, the sitter was so pleased with the composition that she asked Boldini to enlarge it and include her son. In order to prepare for the final version, Boldini had the original photographed, pasted it onto a larger sheet and expanded the composition; this study is in the collection of Vito Doria, Bologna (Dini and Dini 2002, no. 918). An oil study of Consuelo Vanderbilt alone is presently unlocated (Dini and Dini 2002, no. 920). Another oil study for the entire composition was sold at Sotheby's, London, June 22, 1988, no. 419 (formerly Warren collection; not in Dini and Dini 2002).Two sketches exist for this painting (see Vito Doria,Boldini: Inedito, Bologna, 1982, p. 107, and photograph in The Met's archive file).",
        "Loan Restrictions": "Loan of this work is restricted.",
        "Intro Description": "Strikingly beautiful, elegant, and wealthy, with a distinguished family pedigree to match, Consuelo Vanderbilt was the doyenne of international high society. Boldini, one of the most sought-after portraitists of the day, reportedly asked to paint her when she was visiting Paris, finding her \"divine.\" Delighted with the picture, she requested that he enlarge it and include her youngest son. Using a photograph of the portrait, Boldini developed the present, final composition. Hung in the Duchess’s splendid London residence, its dazzling brushwork and elongated curves proved a fitting complement to her glamorous milieu.",

        "Medium:": "Oil and gold on oak",

        "Object Number:": "20.155.4",
        "Catalogue Entry": "The lavish costume, ostentatious jewelry, precious devotional objects, and sumptuous setting of this portrait indicate the high status of Mary Wotton, Lady Guildford, at the court of Henry VIII. It is a copy of the well-known portrait of the same sitter in the Saint Louis Art Museum, which is the pendant of the portrait of Sir Henry Guildford in the Royal Collection at Windsor Castle, both by Hans Holbein the Younger. Mary Wotton was the daughter of Sir Robert Wotton of Boughton Malherbe, Kent, and Anne Belknap. In 1525 she became the second wife of Sir Henry Guildford, an important courtier who served the king in several capacities, including as chamberlain of the receipt of the Exchequer. Each of the portraits of the couple is dated 1527, the year in which Sir Henry, as the king’s master of the revels, was charged with making the arrangements for the king to receive an embassy from France at Greenwich, an event planned to celebrate the peace accord with Francis I. This may have been where Guildford first met Holbein (probably the artist referred to in records of the event as \"Master Hans\"), who was engaged to produce paintings for a banqueting hall and theater at Greenwich. Sir Henry also knew Sir Thomas More and Erasmus, other patrons of Holbein, and they may have introduced him to the esteemed painter. The pendants are among the first that Holbein made after his arrival in England.Although the Museum’s panel was originally thought to be the pendant of the Windsor Castle portrait of Sir Henry Guildford, and by the hand of Holbein himself, it began to lose its place of prominence when the Saint Louis painting surfaced in 1930. Indeed, if The Met's version is compared with the Saint Louis original, considerable differences in technique and execution are observable. While the copy is fairly faithful, its overall quality does not match that of works accepted as completed by Holbein and his workshop. The execution is not as refined, the techniques do not seem to match with Holbein’s workshop practices, and portions of the painting do not correspond correctly to the original.The question has been raised whether the Museum’s copy might have been made in Holbein’s workshop during the artist’s lifetime. Arguments against this possibility are supported by evidence derived from the technical examination of the painting, in particular from the study of the underdrawing. It has been well established that Holbein’s habitual working procedure for portraiture was to employ his preparatory drawing of the sitter as a cartoon, tracing its essential features onto the grounded panel with the aid of an interleafing, carbon-coated sheet. This method was used for the Saint Louis painting, which was based on a rendering of Lady Guildford in colored chalks on paper (Kunstmuseum Basel, Kupferstichkabinett). The Museum’s portrait shows no obvious evidence of a traced pattern for Lady Guildford’s facial features. Furthermore, placing a mylar photostat of the Basel drawing over the painting revealed that, even though the painted contours of the eyelids, nose, and mouth coincide to some degree with the drawing, the contour of the face does not, and the forehead has been elongated by shifting the hood farther upward. Holbein’s workshop pattern was therefore clearly not used for this painting. This examination of the underdrawing, coupled with the known details of Holbein’s execution and handling, indicate that the painting was not made in Holbein’s studio by a workshop assistant but rather was copied after Holbein’s painting at a later moment in time.Clues concerning when the painting might have been made come from x-radiography and dendrochronology. The x-radiograph (see fig. 1 above) shows that the picture was painted on top of another. Turned 180 degrees, the x-radiograph reveals the fragment of a male figure, specifically the left leg from the thigh to the toes and a tiny portion of the right leg above the knee of a man in aristocratic dress, as well as an undetermined oval object in the lower right corner of the painting. The stance of the figure immediately recalls the pose seen in the official full-length portraits of Henry VIII, which derived from the famous Whitehall Palace mural that Holbein painted in 1537, or in those of Edward VI after his coronation. The painting beneath the image of Lady Guildford is not likely to be one of the portraits of Henry, since the left leg (visible in the x-radiograph) is more vertically positioned than the obliquely angled one of the Henry model; it is thus more similar to the Edward VI portraits. The dendrochronology of The Met's painting indicated that it could have been produced at the earliest in 1540 and more likely in 1546 or later—precisely the period in which the new standing portrait models were painted in multiple versions.For reasons that cannot at present be determined, the panel first employed for the probable portrait of an aristocratic man was cut down and reused for the Museum’s Lady Guildford. This might have served as a pendant to a missing copy of Holbein’s portrait of her husband or as an independent portrait; no pendant of Sir Henry matching this work is known. The commission for the copy of the original portrait could have come from members of the Guildford family, the Wottons, or extended family members.An etching by Wenceslaus Hollar depicting Lady Guildford (51.501.2107) is also in The Met's collection.[2013; adapted from Ainsworth in Ainsworth and Waterman 2013]",
        "Technical Notes": "The panel support is composed of three boards of Baltic oak, with the grain oriented vertically. Dendrochronological analysis indicated an earliest possible fabrication date of 1540. The panel has been very slightly thinned and cradled, with the exception of a rectangular area depicting a crest identifying the sitter as Lady Guildford. Two vertical cradle members are interrupted, and two horizontal crossbars were designed to move out from the center to reveal the crest. Three lines of the inscription on the verso are now hidden beneath immobile horizontal crossbars. A split 10.2 centimeters long extends from the edge above the sitter’s head, and the paint is cracked along both panel joins.The paint layers of this picture are in poor condition. Widespread abrasion is concealed with a toned varnish. The flesh is significantly damaged and is missing the necessary shading and modulation to describe the form.X-radiography revealed that the portrait of Lady Guildford was painted on top of another painting, a fragment of a full-length portrait of a man (see fig. 1 above).Examination of samples mounted in cross section revealed a white ground preparation and a white priming layer, the paint layers of the first composition, a white priming applied to conceal this painting, and the paint layers of the portrait of Lady Guildford. Analysis confirmed that the pigments of both paintings are consistent with the 1540s.With the stereomicroscope, contour drawing in the leaves at the right and in the eyes, lips, and nose is visible, although underdrawing was not detected with infrared reflectography.Gold decorations, such as the reflective threads in the sleeves and the embellishments on the gable hood, were created with a buff-colored mordant and now-fragmentary gold leaf, which has been restored with gold paint. The same buff-colored mordant, applied more heavily to create a low-profile relief, was used for the chains around the sitter’s neck. The gilding on the rings and on the tassels hanging from the book used an unpigmented mordant. Overall, the application of the gilding does not display the same level of control or attention to detail as found in Holbein’s autograph portraits.[2013; adapted from German Paintings catalogue]",

        "Catalogue Entry": "The church of San Michele in Isola and the adjoining former Camaldolensian monastery stand on the island of San Michele, which lies in the lagoon between the northeast side of Venice and the island of Murano. Designed in 1469 by Mauro Codussi (ca. 1440–1504), the church was the first and one of the most beautiful to be built in Venice in the Renaissance style. Although the facade of Istrian limestone vaguely recalls the austere facade of Leon Battista Alberti’s Tempio Malatestiano at Rimini, built in 1450, it is capped with a semicircular Veneto-Byzantine gable. The brick campanile is an earlier structure, completed in 1460. The lofty interior of the church was originally graced with Giovanni Bellini’s marvelous altarpiece of theResurrection of Christ(ca. 1480) and Cima da Conegliano’sSacra conversazione(ca. 1495), both now in the Gemäldegalerie, Berlin. The hexagonal Emiliana Chapel, with its unusual limestone dome, was added to the complex in 1530 by the architect Guglielmo Bergamasco. In 1837 the canal separating San Michele from the neighboring island of San Cristoforo della Pace was filled in to form the municipal cemetery, now the resting place of many non-Italian luminaries.While not a particularly favorite subject of painters, the island does appear in panoramic views of the lagoon taken from the Fondamente Nuove, such as those of the early 1720s by Gaspar van Wittel (1653–1736) and Canaletto (1697–1768) and the much later ones by Francesco Tironi (ca. 1745–1797). Not only was it the subject of paintings by Guardi in the collection of John Strange, the British Resident in Venice, but a glimpse of it can also be seen in one of Guardi’s earliest view paintings, formerly in the collection of the comte du Boisrouvray, Neuilly-sur-Seine. There the roof of San Michele in Isola and its campanile rise in the middle distance behind the island of San Cristoforo. The du Boisrouvray canvas also shows Codussi’s dome, which, curiously, is not depicted in The Met's painting. A second, much smaller, late view by Guardi of the island was also formerly in the du Boisrouvray collection.The Met's canvas is unique in that it presents a frontal view of San Michele: all the others show the island at an oblique angle from the northwest, giving prominence to the Emiliana Chapel, as seen in an etching by Antonio Visentini (see fig. 1 above) which served as a prototype for countless copyists.

        "Catalogue Entry": "This small panel was painted in Leiden in 1627, a year in which Van Goyen produced an impressive number of paintings and drawings, including a sketchbook. Both the subject and the compositional type, with its diagonal road and wedge-shaped repoussoir, are found frequently in the artist's oeuvre from the late 1620s to about 1640. Works by Van Goyen like this picture influenced his contemporary Pieter de Molijn, the slightly younger Salomon van Ruysdael, and other landscapists in the area of Haarlem and Amsterdam.The rugged oak on the left is one of the painter's standard motifs; similar survivors from the windswept dunes near the Dutch coast are placed prominently in paintings dating from his earliest years. An almost leafless tree trunk is set slightly deeper in space, framing a distant church tower. The recession through the middle ground is clarified by the comparative scale of the two resting figures and that of the man in the distance walking with a dog, while weathered farm buildings stand out in the late-afternoon sun. The dark clouds passing through the blue sky recall an observation made by Max Friedländer (inLandscape, Portrait, Still-Life: Their Origin and Development, New York, 1963, p. 95) that a view by Van Goyen usually promises rain, whereas in scenes by Van Ruysdael the clouds have retreated, driven off by a fresh breeze.The Met's picture dates from about the time that Van Goyen first employed a tonal palette and Baroque compositional designs, as is evident from comparisons with his more colorful but less theatrically staged works of about 1624–26. Paintings dating from 1628 through the early 1630s reveal many of the same devices, especially the division of terrain into contrasting areas. But the pattern used here was promptly transformed into subtler arrangements, usually in broader vistas with more diffused effects of light and atmosphere.The care with which Van Goyen composed works of this type is also clear from his sketchbook of 1627, which comprises about fifty ideas for paintings recorded \"from life.\" For this type of design, the artist was indebted to his teacher Esaias van de Velde (1587–1630), who anticipates the present picture in a drawing of about 1616 (Morgan Library & Museum, New York). However, Van Goyen eschews his master's fondness for graceful motifs in favor of more rugged forms. Their tactile qualities are emphasized to both descriptive and artistic effect, as in the sunlit grass that flows like seaweed over the sandy ground.Although rich in observations made out of doors, landscapes like this one are very much products of the studio. The subject of bucolic cottages flourished in Holland during the early seventeenth century and was encouraged by literature celebrating the supposed pleasures of a simple life lived on the land.[2016; adapted from Liedtke 2007]",

        "Object Number:": "87.15.93",
        "Catalogue Entry": "First version:The original version of The Met’s painting was first exhibited at the Paris Salon of 1831, bearing the titleHadji-Bey, Chief of Police in Smyrna, Making His Rounds(Wallace Collection, London).[1] Both versions are widely known asThe Turkish Patrol. The Wallace picture was the first scene of daily life in the Middle East painted by an artist who had been there. In 1828, Decamps traveled to Izmir (as Smyrna has been known since the 1920s) as part of an expedition intended to yield a painting of the Battle of Navarino, fought on October 27, 1827, which was a turning point in the Greek War for Independence from the Ottoman Empire because it resulted in the devastation of the Ottoman naval fleet. In Decamps’s painting, a distant culture often presented to Europeans as violent and cruel assumed an aspect lacking those traits. While Salon visitors inclined to do so could corroborate the painting’s subject with written accounts of Izmir by other travelers, the painting relies on a degree of caricatural distortion that puzzled viewers.The Turkish Patrolwas Decamps’s breakthrough work, with critic Gustave Planche likening its significance to that of Eugène Delacroix’sLiberty Leading the People(1830, Musée du Louvre, Paris), the renowned battle scene in which real and allegorical elements were combined to commemorate the July Revolution of 1830.[2] Nearly two decades later, in 1848, Théophile Gautier wrote in reference toThe Turkish Patrolthat “painting, like poetry, had itsOrientales,” thereby situating Decamps’s canvas as the equivalent of Victor Hugo’s 1829 collection of verse as milestones in the widening of imaginative horizons in the arts through their evocations of the Middle East.[3] This development came to be known as Orientalism, a phenomenon in the sphere of European culture that would take on new and less benign dimensions of significance following the French invasion of Algeria in 1830.Second version:The foregoing account gives some sense of the stature of the first version ofThe Turkish Patrol, when, in 1855, it was featured in the Exposition Universelle, the first world’s fair to be held in Paris. Decamps was one of only four living artists accorded a retrospective exhibition there, along with Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres, Horace Vernet, and Delacroix. Despite the total absence of surviving documentation accounting for the origins of the second version ofThe Turkish Patrol, one may credibly assert that it was produced for a collector who had admired the first version at the fair.[4]The Met canvas is only one-third the size of the one Decamps had used for the Wallace version, but, in terms of proportion, it is narrower and therefore taller. Accordingly, Decamps adjusted the setting, with consequences for the figures. The patrol consists of ten men in both paintings, but whereas they appear to spill out from the right edge of the picture in the first version, with space to pivot towards the shop on the left, in the second version their advance appears to be somewhat arrested as they reach the picture’s left edge. The primary edifice plays a more muscular role in the later version owing to its projecting balcony, with a carpet draped on its ledge. Gone is the glimpse of verdant, tree-filled space at the upper right corner, which functioned, together with the bright patch of sky above the alley, to provide a sense of lightness to the rather plain facade situated between them. The charming vignette of the women peering at the scene below—three at a terrace and another at a window—has been transformed into a pair of women peering from a single window, deep in shadow at the far right.The broader brushwork of Decamps’s later style, combined with the reduced size of the second version and alterations to the composition, produce an overall heaviness; that effect has been exacerbated by a progressive darkening of the surface that may have begun shortly after it was finished, which is perhaps why writers described it as a night scene as early as 1880.[5] This has made it difficult to differentiate the skin tones that are an important feature of the figures in the first version, where one sees grouped together in the patrol a blond-mustachioed European man, a dark-skinned man of African origin, and other men depicted with varying fleshtones, together representing the polyglot makeup of the Ottoman Empire. Decamps made multiple changes to the dress of the patrolmen in the second version. In both works they wear garments and accessories first associated with Zeybeks and, later, with Bashi-Bazouks.[6] However, while in the first version one man is depicted with his head shaved save for one area left long at the top, in traditional Turkic fashion, in the second version one man is shown wearing a fez, a sign of modern reform governed by regulations imposed in 1829.Asher Miller 2023[1] Oil on canvas, 45 1/16 x 70 ½ in.

        "Intro Description": "The present picture depicts Turkish military patrols making their rounds at Smyrna—now Izmir—which Decamps visited in 1828. It is a late variant of his first major Orientalist subject, exhibited at the Paris Salon of 1831 (now in the Wallace Collection, London). Decamps belonged to the first generation of French painters to popularize scenes of everyday life set in the Middle East.This painting belonged to The Metropolitan Museum's first president, John Taylor Johnston, until 1876, when it was purchased by Catharine Lorillard Wolfe, the Museum's first woman benefactor.",

        "Catalogue Entry": "This picture was painted in 1653 for the Sicilian nobleman Don Antonio Ruffo (1610/11–1678) and sent from Amsterdam to his palace in Messina during the summer of 1654. Ruffo was an avid collector; at his death he had 364 paintings, including a work by Van Dyck,Saint Rosalie Interceding for the Plague-stricken of Palermo, now also in The Met (71.41). Though he went out of his way to collect works by famous masters, Ruffo rarely left Messina. He ordered this work through an agent, Giacomo di Battista, who did business with Cornelis Gijsbrechtsz, a wealthy Amsterdam merchant. Shortly after its delivery, the picture was recorded in Ruffo's inventory (1657) as a half-length figure of a philosopher, possibly Aristotle or Albertus Magnus. Based on this description, Giltaij (1999) concludes that Ruffo did not have a particular subject in mind when he made the commission, but probably asked for a half-length figure of a certain size. The dimensions given in the inventory are 8 x 6 palmi, equivalent to about 178 x 134 cm. (one palmo romano was about 22.34 cm.) and considerably larger than the current dimensions of the painting. Kirby (1992) explains, however, that the dimensions in palmi used in the Ruffo inventories were inexact measurements meant only as a guide. X-radiography confirms that the painting is close to, if not exactly, its original size.In 1660, Ruffo commissioned a pendant for theAristotlefrom the Bolognese artist Guercino (1591–1666), providing him with the desired dimensions and a sketch of the Rembrandt painting. In a letter to Ruffo of October 6, 1660, Guercino notes that \"to accompany Rembrandt's which I judge to represent a Physiognomist, I thought it most fitting to make a Cosmographer . . . \" Guercino's painting is now lost, but is known from a drawing in the Princeton University Art Museum.Ruffo also ordered companion paintings from Rembrandt. They are theAlexander the Greatof 1661 (now lost) and the fragmentaryHomer(Mauritshuis, The Hague), dated 1663. Both are mentioned in an invoice dated July 30, 1661. In a letter of November 1, 1662, Ruffo addressed a letter to the Dutch consul in Messina, expressing dissatisfaction with the painting of Alexander and noting that he paid more for it than for the Aristotle; that the subject was in fact Aristotle had probably been clarified for Ruffo once he commissioned the other works from Rembrandt.Until 1917, when Hoogewerff connected the newly published Ruffo documents with this painting, the subject had been variously identified as Ariosto, Tasso, Virgil, an imaginary man of letters, philospoher, or savant, or an actual poet or scholar of Rembrandt's time, such as Pieter Cornelisz Hooft.Julius Held's analysis of the subject in an article of 1969 is still widely upheld. According to Held, Aristotle compares \"two sets of values\": on the one hand, everything that he admired in Homer—gravity, humility, \"unequalled diction and thought\"—and, on the other, wealth and worldly honor as embodied by the gold chain and medallion bearing an image of Aristotle's royal pupil, Alexander the Great.[2010; adapted from Liedtke 2007]",

        "Intro Description": "Among the most celebrated works of art at The Met, this painting conveys Rembrandt’s meditation on the meaning of fame. The richly clad Greek philosopher Aristotle (384–322 BCE) rests his hand pensively on a bust of Homer, the epic poet who had attained literary immortality with hisIliadandOdysseycenturies before. Aristotle wears a gold medallion with a portrait of his powerful pupil, Alexander the Great—perhaps the philosopher is weighing his own worldly success against Homer’s timeless achievement. Although the work has come to be considered quintessentially Dutch, it was painted for a Sicilian patron at a moment when Rembrandt’s signature style, with its dark palette and almost sculptural buildup of paint, was beginning to fall out of fashion in Amsterdam.",

        "Catalogue Entry": "The Swiss-born Angelica Kauffmann belonged to Rome’s Accademia di San Luca from an early age and had been a founder member in 1768 of the Royal Academy in London. While her preference was for history painting, her considerable fortune and her fame came from portraiture. With her second husband, Antonio Zucchi, she settled permanently in Rome in 1782. Angelica was known as a singer and a linguist, as well as for her skills as an artist, and she had a wide acquaintance, and took sittings not only from Italians but also from visitors of many different European nationalities to the Italian capital. The Zucchis met Monsignor Spina no later than 1788, as he is mentioned in a letter she addressed on August 13 to the poet and writer Johann Wolfgang Goethe. Spina, ordained in 1796, was just embarking on a career as a diplomat in the service of the church. He wears the purple robes trimmed with red of a bishop or monsignor and a magnificent lace surplice. His brown eyes and dark eyebrows are set off by a high forehead, a receding hairline, and tightly curled and powdered hair. He holds a letter of several pages which begins with the word \"Caro.\"Giuseppe Maria Spina was born into a noble family in Sarzana and educated at the University of Pisa. An aide to Pius VI, in 1796 he was ordained to the priesthood in Rome. The pope had condemned the civil constitution of the French clergy as well as the French Declaration of the Rights of Man in 1791. When—on February 10, 1798—Napoleon’s armies marched on Rome, entered unopposed, and declared the Roman Republic, Pius VI was taken prisoner and removed from the Vatican. He was escorted from one north Italian city to another and eventually was settled in Valence, where he died in the summer of 1799. Spina followed the pope and accompanied him into exile. Doubtless in recognition of his services, he was elected titular archbishop of Corinth in summer 1798. The next pope, Pius VII, sent Spina and Cardinal Ercole Consalvi to Paris to negotiate the Concordat of 1801 with the First Consul. In the following year Pius VII elevated Spina to Cardinal and appointed him archbishop of Genoa. Toward the end of his career he served as cardinal-archbishop of Palestrina and also prefect of the apostolicsignatura. He died in Rome in 1828.Katharine Baetjer 2016",

        "Catalogue Entry": "The Artist:One of the leading painters in mid-fourteenth century Italy, Giovanni da Milano was trained in Lombardy, where he developed a style of soft delicacy and precise observation of the natural world. It was his great achievement to combine these traits with the rigorous sense of structure we associate with painting in Florence, where much of his activity was centered. Mid-century Florentine art was dominated by the sculptor-painter Andrea di Cione, better known as Orcagna. He rejected the fluid space and deep humanity found in the work of Giotto in favor of a more constricted, cubic space inhabited by stern figures. This style has been described as ritualistic and authoritarian—a revival of a medieval world view. However, there can be no denying that a more rigorous pictorial unity was achieved: austere and abstract, but possessing an almost tactile physicality. Giovanni da Milano brings to this austere art a subtle use of color and a feeling for sensuous beauty that have reminded some critics of the work of Simone Martini, and an acute observation of nature: \"a harmony between sacred and profane poetics\" (Roberto Longhi, the greatest twentieth-century critic of Italian art).Giovanni da Milano’s life is not well documented. He was from Caversaccio, near Como, and probably moved from Lombardy to Florence a few years before 1346, when the name of \"Johannes Jacobi de Commo\" is listed together with other foreign artists liable to be expelled from Florence. As \"da Milano\" he was recorded in the matriculations of the Arte dei Medici e Speziali, between 1358 and 1363, and in a third document from 1363, when he owned three plots of land in the surroundings of Florence. In 1366, he and his sons became Florentine citizens. Together with other Florentine painters, in 1369 Giovanni was appointed to work in the Vatican; his work there does not survive (see Alberto Lenza, \"Appendice documentaria su Giovanni a Milano,\" inGiovanni da Milano, exh. cat., Florence, 2008, pp. 297–306).Giovanni signed only two works: a polyptych for the Spedale della Misericordia in Prato (now in the local museum), probably dateable shortly after 1355; and thePietàfrom the church of San Girolamo alla Costa (but perhaps originaly for the nearby church of San Giorgio alla Costa), of 1365 (now in the Gallerie dell’Accademia, Florence).The Painting:The picture depicts three episodes from the life of Christ. At the center is the Resurrection, with Christ standing on the lid of the sealed tomb, the top of which is sharply foreshortened. In one hand he holds a banner of victory while he raises the other in benediction. Around the tomb, their poses wonderfully varied, are the sleeping soldiers who had been charged to guard his sepulcher. This scene is set off from the other two by trees that reach the full height of the picture field. On the left we see Christ, his face wearing an expression of compassionate forgiveness, bending toward Saint Peter, who kneels, averting his gaze. Christ’s firm gesture confers a formal, liturgical quality on the scene, in which he charges Saint Peter to attend to the faithful (\"Feed my sheep\"). His ritualistic gesture is contrasted with the rich cascade of drapery, the edges of the cloaks being picked out in gold. The right hand scene describes an encounter of a very different kind. Mary Magdalen kneels before Christ, extending her hands as though to touch him. He withdraws, but turns toward her, his face showing great tenderness, his hand raised in a gesture of admonition (\"Noli me tangere\": Do not cling to me). The subtext of this tripartite scene would seem to be touch and sight as a means of spiritual apprehension. The depiction of Christ and Saint Peter—in which sight is averted and touch affirmed—is obviously the counterpoint to Christ and Mary Magdalen—in which there is a meaningful exchange of glances but touch is denied. Again, the two hands resting on the lid of the sarcophagus would seem to reinforce this theme, which in fact was a theological issue (see below, underPossible Theological Significance).The combination of the three scenes in a single picture field is highly unusual, if not unique. Indeed, so unusual is the scene of Christ and Saint Peter that it has been interpreted both as Christ saving the apostle from drowning (though there is no water) and as Christ conferring his authority on the apostle. This emphasis of Christ’s authority may reinforce the hypothesis that the altarpiece came from a church dedicated to Christ the Savior—San Salvatore—such as the Florentine foundations at Settimo and Camaldoli (for this provenance see Bernacchioni 2008 and Parenti 2008). Strehlke (2008) has suggested as a possible location the chapel of the archbishop of Florence.Reconstruction of the Altarpiece:Marabottini (1950) was the first to consider the panel of Christ Enthroned (Pinacoteca di Brera, Milan) as the center of a polyptych that had on the left hand a panel with eleven saints (Galleria Sabauda, Turin); the right hand panel is still missing. Davies (The Earlier Italian Schools, London, 1961) identified three pinnacle panels respectively depicting the Virgin, Christ of the Apocalypse, and John the Baptist (all in the National Gallery, London), and Boskovits (1966) tentatively connected all these paintings to two predella panels formerly in the Bacri collection (that is, the present panel and the scene of Christ and the apostles with Saint Thomas who places his finger in the wound in Christ’s side, now in the Alana collection (see Travi 2014). This suggestion was later supported by Mina Gregori (1972) and by all the other scholars who have written about this work (see fig. 1 above). A previously unknown fragment of the third scene of the predella was sold at Sotheby’s, New York (January 29, 2015, lot 1), and is now in the Alana collection. It shows Christ’s descent into Limbo, with his hand grasping an Old Testament patriarch. This recent discovery has made clear the original sequence of the three predella panels, which showed, left to right, the Descent into Limbo, the Resurrection, and the Doubting of Saint Thomas, thus confirming the hypothesis of Parenti (2008).Possible Theological Significance:What unites the three scenes of the predella are the themes of sight and, especially, touch as a means of recognizing Christ. Regarding this it is worth citing the following, long passages from Saint Augustine’sTractates on the Gospel of John: Tractate 121, relating to John 20:10–29 (translated by John Gibb, fromNicene and Post-Nicene Fathers, First Series, vol. 7, ed. Philip Schaff, Buffalo, N.Y., Christian Literature Publishing Co., 1888; revised and edited for New Advent by Kevin Knight: http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/1701121.htm):\"1. Mary Magdalene had brought the news to His disciples, Peter and John, that the Lord was taken away from the sepulchre; and they, when they came there, found only the linen clothes wherewith the body had been shrouded; and what else could they believe but what she had told them, and what she had herself also believed? ‘Then the disciples went away again unto their own’ (home); that is to say, where they were dwelling, and from which they had run to the sepulchre. ‘But Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping.’ For while the men returned, the weaker sex was fastened to the place by a stronger affection. And the eyes, which had sought the Lord and had not found Him, had now nothing else to do but weep, deeper in their sorrow that He had been taken away from the sepulchre than that He had been slain on the tree; seeing that in the case even of such a Master, when His living presence was withdrawn from their eyes, His remembrance also had ceased to remain. Such grief, therefore, now kept the woman at the sepulchre. ‘And as she wept, she stooped down, and looked into the sepulchre.’ Why she did so I know not. For she was not ignorant that He whom she sought was no longer there, since she had herself also carried word to the disciples that He had been taken from thence; while they, too, had come to the sepulchre, and had sought the Lord's body, not merely by looking, but also by entering, and had not found it. What then does it mean, that, as she wept, she stooped down, and looked again into the sepulchre? Was it that her grief was so excessive that she hardly thought she could believe either their eyes or her own? Or was it rather by some divine impulse that her mind led her to look within? For look she did, ‘and saw two angels in white, sitting, the one at the head and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.’ Why is it that one was sitting at the head, and the other at the feet? Was it, since those who in Greek are called angels are in Latinnuntii[news-bearers], that in this way they signified that the gospel of Christ was to be preached from head to foot, from the beginning even to the end? ‘They say to her, Woman, why do you weep? She says unto them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid Him.’ The angels forbade her tears: for by such a position what else did they announce, but that which in some way or other was a future joy? For they put the question, ‘Why do you weep?’ as if they had said, Weep not. But she, supposing they had put the question from ignorance, unfolded the cause of her tears. ‘Because,’ she said, ‘they have taken away my Lord:’ calling her Lord's inanimate body her Lord, meaning a part for the whole; just as all of us acknowledge that Jesus Christ, the only Son of God, our Lord, who of course is at once both the Word and soul and flesh, was nevertheless crucified and buried, while it was only His flesh that was laid in the sepulchre. ‘And I know not,’ she added, ‘where they have laid Him.’ This was the greater cause of sorrow, because she knew not where to go to mitigate her grief. But the hour had now come when the joy, in some measure announced by the angels, who forbade her tears, was to succeed the weeping.2. Lastly, ‘when she had thus said, she turned herself back, and saw Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus. Jesus says unto her, Woman, why do you weep? Whom do you seek? She, supposing Him to be the gardener, says unto Him, Sir, If you have borne Him hence, tell me where you have laid Him, and I will take Him away. Jesus says unto her, Mary. She turned herself, and says unto Him, Rabboni, which is to say, Master.’ Let no one speak ill of the woman because she called the gardener, Sir (domine), and Jesus, Master. For there she was asking, here she was recognizing; there she was showing respect to a person of whom she was asking a favor, here she was recalling the Teacher of whom she was learning to discern things human and divine. She called one lord (sir), whose handmaid she was not, in order by him to get at the Lord to whom she belonged. In one sense, therefore, she used the word Lord when she said, ‘They have taken away my Lord; and in another, when she said, Sir (lord), if you have borne Him hence.’ For the prophet also called those lords who were mere men, but in a different sense from Him of whom it is written, ‘The Lord is His name.’ But how was it that this woman, who had already turned herself back to see Jesus, when she supposed Him to be the gardener, and was actually talking with Him, is said to have again turned herself, in order to say unto Him ‘Rabboni,’ but just because, when she then turned herself in body, she supposed Him to be what He was not, while now, when turned in heart, she recognized Him to be what He was.3. ‘Jesus says unto her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; to my God, and your God.’ There are points in these words which we must examine with brevity indeed, but with somewhat more than ordinary attention.For Jesus was giving a lesson in faith to the woman, who had recognized Him as her Master, and called Him so in her reply; and this gardener was sowing in her heart, as in His own garden, the grain of mustard seed. What then is meant by ‘Touch me not’? And just as if the reason of such a prohibition would be sought, He added, ‘for I am not yet ascended to my Father.’ What does this mean? If, while standing on earth, He is not to be touched, how could He be touched by men when sitting in heaven? For certainly, before He ascended, He presented Himself to the touch of the disciples, when He said, as testified by the evangelist Luke, ‘Handle me, and see; for a spirit has not flesh and bones, as you see me have;’ [Luke 24:39] or when He said to Thomas the disciple, ‘Reach hither your finger, and behold my hands; and put forth your hand, and thrust it into my side.’ And who could be so absurd as to affirm that He was willing indeed to be touched by the disciples before He ascended to the Father, but refused it in the case of women till after His ascension? But no one, even had any the will, was to be allowed to run into such folly. For we read that women also, after His resurrection and before His ascension to the Father, touched Jesus, among whom was Mary Magdalene herself; for it is related by Matthew that Jesus met them, and said, ‘All hail. And they approached, and held Him by the feet, and worshipped Him.’ [Matthew 28:9] This was passed over by John, but declared as the truth by Matthew. It remains, therefore, that some sacred mystery must lie concealed in these words; and whether we discover it or utterly fail to do so, yet we ought to be in no doubt as to its actual existence. Accordingly, either the words, ‘Touch me not, for I am not yet ascended to my Father,’ had this meaning, that by this woman the Church of the Gentiles was symbolized, which did not believe in Christ till He had actually ascended to the Father, or that in this way Christ wished Himself to be believed on; in other words, to be touched spiritually, that He and the Father are one.For He has in a manner ascended to the Father, to the inward perception of him who has made such progress in the knowledge of Christ that he acknowledges Him as equal with the Father: in any other way He is not rightly touched, that is to say, in any other way He is not rightly believed on. But Mary might have still so believed as to account Him unequal with the Father, and this certainly is forbidden her by the words, ‘Touch me not;’ that is, Believe not thus on me according to your present notions; let not your thoughts stretch outwards to what I have been made in your behalf, without passing beyond to that whereby you have yourself been made. For how could it be otherwise than carnally that she still believed on Him whom she was weeping over as a man? ‘For I am not yet ascended,’ He says, ‘to my Father:’ there shall you touch me, when you believe me to be God, in no wise unequal with the Father. ‘But go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father.’ He says not, Our Father: in one sense, therefore, is He mine, in another sense, yours; by nature mine, by grace yours. ‘And my God, and your God.’ Nor did He say here, Our God: here, therefore, also is He in one sense mine, in another sense yours: my God; under whom I also am as man; your God, between whom and you I am mediator.4. ‘Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples, I have seen the Lord, and He has spoken these things unto me. Then the same day at evening, being the first day of the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, came Jesus, and stood in the midst, and says unto them, Peace be unto you. And when He had so said, He showed unto them His hands and His side.’ For nails had pierced His hands, a spear had laid open His side: and there the marks of the wounds are preserved for healing the hearts of the doubting. But the shutting of doors presented no obstacle to the matter of His body, wherein Godhead resided. He indeed could enter without their being opened, by whose birth the virginity of His mother remained inviolate, ‘Then were the disciples glad when they saw the Lord. Then said He unto them again, Peace be unto you.’ Reiteration is confirmation; for He Himself gives by the prophet a promised peace upon peace. ‘As the Father has sent me,’ He adds, ‘even so send I you.’ We know the Son to be equal to the Father; but here we recognize the words of the Mediator. For He exhibits Himself as occupying a middle position when He says, He me, and I you. ‘And when He had said this, He breathed on them, and said unto them, Receive the Holy Ghost.’ By breathing on them He signified that the Holy Spirit was the Spirit, not of the Father alone, but likewise His own. ‘Whose soever sins,’ He continues, ‘ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and whose soever ye retain, they are retained.’ The Church's love, which is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit, discharges the sins of all who are partakers with itself, but retains the sins of those who have no participation therein. Therefore it is, that after saying ‘Receive the Holy Ghost,’ He straightway added this regarding the remission and retention of sins.5. ‘But Thomas, one of the twelve, who is called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came. The other disciples therefore said unto him, We have seen the Lord. But he said unto them, Except I shall see in His hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the place of the nails, and put my hand into His side, I will not believe. And after eight days, again His disciples were within, and Thomas with them. Then came Jesus, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, Peace be unto you. Then says He to Thomas, Reach hither your finger, and behold my hands; and reach hither your hand, and put it into my side: and be not faithless, but believing. Thomas answered and said unto Him, My Lord and my God.’ He saw and touched the man, and acknowledged the God whom he neither saw nor touched; but by the means of what he saw and touched, he now put far away from him every doubt, and believed the other. ‘Jesus says unto him, Because you have seen me, you have believed.’He says not, You have touched me, but, ‘You have seen me,’ because sight is a kind of general sense. For sight is also habitually named in connection with the other four senses: as when we say, Listen, and see how well it sounds; smell it, and see how well it smells; taste it, and see how well it savors; touch it, and see how hot it is. Everywhere has the word, See, made itself heard, although sight, properly speaking, is allowed to belong only to the eyes. Hence here also the Lord Himself says, ‘Reach hither your finger, and behold my hands:’ and what else does He mean but, Touch and see? And yet he had no eyes in his finger. Whether therefore it was by looking, or also by touching, ‘Because you have seen me,’ He says, ‘you have believed.’ Although it may be affirmed that the disciple dared not so to touch, when He offered Himself for the purpose; for it is not written, And Thomas touched Him. But whether it was by gazing only, or also by touching that he saw and believed, what follows rather proclaims and commends the faith of the Gentiles: ‘Blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed.’He made use of words in the past tense, as One who, in His predestinating purpose, knew what was future, as if it had already taken place. But the present discourse must be kept from the charge of prolixity: the Lord will give us the opportunity to discourse at another time on the topics that remain.\"Saint Augustine continues this theme in his discussion of Christ’s charge to Saint Peter, found in John 20:30–21:11 (Tractate 122):\"1. After telling us of the incident in connection with which the disciple Thomas had offered to his touch the places of the wounds in Christ's body, and saw what he would not believe, and believed, the evangelist John interposes these words, and says: ‘And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of His disciples, which are not written in this book: but these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye may have life through His name.’ This paragraph indicates, as it were, the end of the book; but there is afterwards related how the Lord manifested Himself at the sea of Tiberias, and in the draught of fishes made special reference to the mystery of the Church, as regards its future character, in the final resurrection of the dead. I think, therefore, it is fitted to give special prominence thereto, that there has been thus interposed, as it were, an end of the book, and that there should be also a kind of preface to the narrative that was to follow, in order in some measure to give it a position of greater eminence. The narrative itself begins in this way: ‘After these things Jesus showed Himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias; and on this wise showed He (Himself). There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two other of His disciples. Simon Peter says unto them, I go a fishing. They say unto him, We also go with you.’2. The inquiry is usually made in connection with this fishing of the disciples, why Peter and the sons of Zebedee returned to what they were before being called by the Lord; for they were fishers when He said to them, ‘Come after me, and I will make you fishers of men.’ [Matthew 4:19] And they put such reality into their following of Him then, that they left all in order to cleave to Him as their Master: so much so, that when the rich man went away from Him in sorrow, because of His saying to him, ‘Go sell that you have, and give to the poor, and you shall have treasure in heaven, and come follow me,’ Peter said unto Him, ‘Lo, we have forsaken all, and followed You.’ Why is it then that now, by the abandonment as it were of their apostleship, they become what they were, and seek again what they had forsaken, as if forgetful of the words they had once listened to, ‘No man, putting his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of heaven’? [Luke 9:62] Had they done so when Jesus was lying in the grave, before He rose from the dead—which of course they could not have done, as the day whereon He was crucified kept them all in closest attention till His burial, which took place before evening; while the next day was the Sabbath, when it was unlawful for those who observed the ancestral custom to work at all; and on the third day the Lord rose again, and recalled them to the hope which they had not yet begun to entertain regarding Him—yet had they then done so, we might suppose it had been done under the influence of that despair which had taken possession of their minds.But now, after His restoration to them alive from the tomb, after the most evident truth of His revivified flesh offered to their eyes and hands, not only to be seen, but also to be touched and handled; after inspecting the very marks of the wounds, even to the confession of the Apostle Thomas, who had previously declared that he would not otherwise believe; after the reception by His breathing on them of the Holy Spirit, and after the words poured from His lips into their ears, \"As the Father has sent me, even so send I you: whose so ever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and whose soever ye retain, they are retained:’ they suddenly become again what they had been, fishers, not of men, but of fishes.\"Keith Christiansen and Mattia Vinco 2017",

        "Intro Description": "At left, Christ addresses Saint Peter; in the center, the resurrected Christ stands on the sealed tomb, surrounded by sleeping soldiers; at right, the risen Christ tells Mary Magdalen that he cannot yet be touched (\"Noli me tangere\"). The theme of apprehending the miraculous or divine through sight and/or touch is marvelously explored in these Biblical episodes (note the soldier whose hand rests on the sarcophagus). A rigorous sense of geometry coupled with delicacy of execution and a keen awareness of the importance of interval are intrinsic to Giovanni da Milano’s art.This panel is from the base (predella) of a complex altarpiece and dates to the 1360s.",

        "Catalogue Entry": "La Joue was the son of a master mason, and it is perhaps unsurprising that his talents were as a designer and painter of ornament and architecture. He was received into the Académie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture on presentation of two imaginary architectural views in 1721 and, with the reestablishment of the Paris Salon, regularly exhibited decorative paintings there between 1737 and 1753. He was influenced by both Antoine Watteau (1684–1721) and François Boucher (1703–1770), collaborating with the latter on a design for fireworks in 1729. La Joue's decorative style epitomized the rococo idiom in France. Although his popularity waned toward the end of his career, his work remained one of the most important sources of rococo imagery and was widely reproduced in engravings.The scale and shaped bottom edge of thisAllegory of Wintersuggest it was originally an overdoor, perhaps one of a series representing the Four Seasons. At the center of the composition are statues of a woman and a putto, veiled to protect themselves from the cold. They are set atop a frozen fountain sculpted with typically rococo scrolls and curves; even the bare branches of the trees seem to conform to an arching arabesque design. La Joue's composition echoes that of another of his winter overdoors (private collection) which dates between 1735 and 1740 and shares the muted palette and pale red sun.[Francesca Whitlum-Cooper 2010]",

There is no record of a Princess Wilhelmine of Saxe-Gotha in the first years of the eighteenth century, the period to which this miniature belongs. Comparison with a miniature by Benjamin Arlaud of Caroline of Ansbach in the Royal Collection, Windsor Castle, which is believed to have been painted about 1714, suggests that this may be by the same artist and of the same sitter (Richard Walker,The Eighteenth and Early Nineteenth Century Miniatures in the Collection of Her Majesty the Queen, Cambridge, 1992, no. 131, ill.). The princess's full name was Wilhelmina Carolina, and the inscription on the back may preserve a traditional identification of her as the sitter. Against the attribution of the present work to Benjamin Arlaud must be held the fact that it is on ivory; the artist is only known to have used vellum as a support, although ivory was coming into use at about this time.In 1705 Caroline of Brandenburg-Ansbach married George Augustus (1683–1760), elector-prince of Hanover and later George II (1727–60) of Great Britain and Ireland. She was remarkable for her intellectual powers and was a friend of Leibnitz and of Newton; Alexander Pope, John Gay, and Lord Chesterfield were among the distinguished members of her circle.Arlaud is believed to have been born in Geneva about 1670. He painted William III (1650–1702) in 1701, though it is not certain that this was in England; he was definitely there no later than 1709. His elder brother Jacques Antoine Arlaud (1668–1746), who spent much of his working life in Paris, had a more flamboyant style.[2016; adapted from Reynolds and Baetjer 1996]",

        "Catalogue Entry": "This signed panel is typical of Van Vries, and also of the Dutch landscapes that constitute part of The Met's founding purchase of 1871. It depicts an ensemble of dilapidated buildings nestled at a turn in a tranquil waterway. The humble residence on the right was built against a medieval wall and a gate tower that recalls Jan van Goyen's versions ofThe Pelkus Gate near Utrecht(including45.146.3in The Met’s collection) and similar structures. The rickety shed perched perilously on the riverbank is either a privy or a run-in stall for animals. Four rustic male figures animate the scene, which seems set at the end of a typical working day in an unprosperous part of the countryside. The man in the boat struggles with a fish trap; a second large, urn-shaped basket has been hauled into his vessel, and a third rests in the boat to the left. The man in an apron on the shoreline who appears to be speaking holds a basket of fish and a walking stick. On the pathway, a shepherd follows his little flock, while a man looks on from the cottage doorway.The picture probably takes its nineteenth-century title from the wooden shelter with a slanted roof on the tower, and from the birds fluttering about. Smaller birds may have nested inside the earthenware jugs mounted sideways on the chimney of the house. In northern Europe, small birds such as sparrows and finches would have attracted innocent admiration but pigeons were kept for food.Similar towers, usually attached to the remains of a fortified wall, occur in a number of paintings by Claes Molenaer (1628/29–1676) and Cornelis Decker (ca. 1615–1678). Van Vries himself often depicted tall, square towers, some as parts of city gates, others as church towers, but most of them are attached to ruined castles or river forts. In all Van Vries's paintings of this type, walls of bricks are featured for the pictorial interest of their colors, textures, and accidental effects. This taste flourished in the 1650s and 1660s, as is seen also in the work of artists such as Daniel Vosmaer (1622–1669/70), Jan van Kessel (1641–1680), Jan van der Heyden, Pieter de Hooch, and Emanuel Murant.Assigning dates to pictures by Van Vries is mere guesswork, but the style and composition of The Met's picture are most consistent with landscape conventions of the 1660s.[2016; adapted from Liedtke 2007]",

The women’s suggestive attitudes—and Warrener’s ear, reddened in embarrassment—indicate the risqué nature of their conversation. This painting served as a preparatory study for a color lithograph of 1892.",

        "Catalogue Entry": "The Artist: For a biography of Salvator Rosa, see the Catalogue Entry forSelf-Portrait(21.105).The Picture:In 1857, Gustav Friedrich Waagen (see Ref.) described “two very poetic and carefully executed landscapes” that hung above the doors in the drawing room of Osterley Park, Lord Jersey’s Georgian estate in West London.Bandits on a Rocky Coastwas one of these pictures, along with a companion piece,Landscape with Herdsmen(Francis Lehman Loeb Art Gallery, Vassar College; 1935.3). Given the discrepancies in their sizes,Landscape with Herdsmenis not a pendant toBandits on a Rocky Coast, but the two along with aLandscape with a Lake, Mountains, and Five Figures(Ringling Museum of Art, Sarasota; SN154) comprise a group of landscapes from the late 1650s that prominently feature the mountainous topography of the Roman countryside. Helen Langdon (2010) has noted that this group of pictures demonstrates an approach to landscape painting influenced by Rosa’s contemporary, Gaspard Dughet, a French painter in Rome who specialized in pastoral landscapes, such as The Met’sImaginary Landscape(08.227.1). The Neoclassical Gallery at Lord Jersey’s estate paired Rosa’s landscapes alongside other works by Dughet, Claude Lorrain, and Nicholas Poussin, a stunning showcase of the field of seventeenth-century landscape painting in Rome.[1]The sublime force ofBandits on a Rocky Coastcomes from the strong diagonal of the flowing water that organizes the composition between the figures in the left foreground with the rocks at right that ascend from the natural arch over the water into a looming mass of cliffs. A “blasted tree” punctuates the right side of the canvas, executed with vibrant daubs of paint as if rustling in a stiff breeze, a characteristic touch of Rosa’s landscapes. Rosa had originally left the middle and upper right of the canvas open to the sky, but later built up the mossy crags as to evoke the awe-inspiring and enveloping power of the natural world. This seclusion also serves to add mystery to the soldiers and bandits who gather, discussing, gesturing, and resting: are they plotting their next attack, or resting from a previous one?Stories of bandits terrorizing the countryside and their frequent appearance in Rosa’s sweeping landscapes in turn helped them become markers of the genre of the Sublime landscape. In eighteenth-century England, romance novels satiated the taste for titillating stories of these fearsome figures, always lurking around mysterious places or along the road, a taste that was in part cultivated by the popularity of Rosa’s landscapes. The proto-Romantic character of Rosa’s landscapes morphed into ideas about Rosa himself, culminating in Lady Morgan’s overly romanticized biography of the Neapolitan artist. To Lady Morgan and many others, Rosa was seen as a Gothic hero from a romance novel. She even read one of his etchings[2] as a direct biographical anecdote, and believed that the artist had been taken captive by bandits in the mountains of Abruzzo and had almost given up hope of escaping when the chief’s daughter pleaded to save his life.[3]Bandits on a Rocky Coastwas likely executed around 1656, following Luigi Salerno’s (1963) suggestion about the painting’s relation to Rosa’sFigurine, a series of more than thirty etchings of figures in various costumes and poses which were similarly executed. This series, dedicated to Rosa’s longstanding friend and patron Carlo de’ Rossi, included several examples of soldiers huddled together in a manner similar to the bandits in The Met’s picture (2012.136.299.9). Salerno remarked that the soldier gesturing in this painting is a nearly identical copy of one of theFigurineetchings, for which there is a preparatory drawing in the Musée du Louvre, Paris.[4] The painting also relates closely to several other canvases done around the second half of the 1650s, particularly to the natural rock arches inMarina con arco roccioso(Palazzo Doria Pamphilj, Rome) and especially to theFinding of Moses(Detroit Institute of Arts, 47.92).The painting’s recent cleaning revealed how carefully Rosa executed the work: he started with the two soldiers in the foreground and then built up layers of glazes and paint around them to create the dynamic atmosphere. This is not the type of picture that was quickly churned out, but rather labored over carefully, with pentiments that include a flag and an extra figure that were painted out to clarify the group of bandits. The glowing sky with sculptural clouds sweeping across the upper register, in particular, is achieved by Rosa vigorously pushing thick paint around the canvas.Banditsis one of the premier examples of the deeply poetic yet savage landscapes for which Rosa became celebrated throughout his career. As Richard Wallace (1979) noted, The Met’s painting “has in abundance all of the characteristics that appeal to the Romantics—a conspiratorial group of bandits isolated in the midst of a savage, hostile wilderness, one of them gesturing in the direction of the distant city near the horizon line; rugged, rocky cliffs and mysterious grottoes; a threatening sky, striking light effects, glittering highlighted textures and deep, gloomy shadows; and the broken, 'storm blasted' tree trunks.”Hannah Segrave 2019[1] Langdon 2010, p. 188.[2] Wallace 1979, no. 59.[3] Lady Morgan,The Life and Times of Salvator Rosa, London, 1824, pp. 117–19.[4] Salerno 1963, p. 124.",

        "Intro Description": "Rosa became known for his distinctive, theatrically dressed figures in the guise of bandits or soldiers set within rugged, menacing landscapes like the one above this doorway. The character of the landscape highlighted the potential ferocity of his protagonists, suggesting a narrative tension even without any identifiable story. Many of the figures in this painting relate to Rosa’s etchings that disseminated his influence across Europe.",

New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2000–.The Painting:This beautifully composed Adoration of the Magi once was the centerpiece of a triptych flanked by aNight Nativity(at the left) and aPresentation in the Temple(at the right) that are currently in a European private collection (sold Christie’s, London, July 7, 2006, no. 122). The outside wings, when closed, showed theAnnunciation(split from the interior wings, whereabouts unknown; see the reconstruction in fig. 1 above). Many of the elements of this triptych derive from works by Gerard David.The Adoration of the Magiis indebted to David’s painting of the same subject of around 1510–15 in the National Gallery, London (fig. 2). It generally adopts the London painting’s composition in which the magi and their entourage, entering a palace in ruins from the right, present their gifts to the Christ Child, sitting in the Virgin’s lap at the far left in the foreground. Each painting presents a city and landscape view, featured like a separately framed vignette, at the center of the picture. In The Met's painting, however, this distant view takes on more prominence and divides the sensitively painted kneeling kings, Virgin and Child, and Joseph at the left, from the animated and more broadly painted group of dandies at the right, who follow the lavishly dressed and elegantly posed Moorish king. TheAnnunciationof the outside wings relates generally to David’s composition from theCervara Altarpieceof 1506 (The Met,50.145.9ab). The interior left wingNight Nativityis a version of a painting by David in the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna, but thePresentation in the Templeof the right wing is not a composition known in David’s extant works.Attribution and Date:Although close to Gerard David in terms of composition and figure types, the majority of this painting was made by an artist—probably in David’s workshop—who could not match the refinement of his master’s handling and execution. Max J. Friedländer (1929) and Leo van Puyvelde (1962) attributed the work to the Master of Hoogstraeten, an Antwerp artist whose works include three other versions of The Met's picture (on the art market, P. de Boer, 1933, with shutters in Museum of Fine Arts, Richmond; in the Mayer van den Bergh Museum, Antwerp; and in the Philadelphia Museum of Art). Although the style and technique of The Met's painting are not close enough to the Master of Hoogstraeten to link it firmly to this master (see Mund et al. 2003), the features of the reconstructed triptych do relate to Antwerp painting of around 1520. TheAdoration of the Magiwas the single most popular theme produced for open-market sale in that city at the time. The expansive view into the distance, showing travelers transporting goods, was a common feature of Adoration scenes, as another Antwerp Master’s work at The Met shows (21.132.2). The popularity of such vignettes was related to the city’s predominance as the economic hub of Western Europe in the early sixteenth century, and the center of the import-export business. Thus the theme of travel, especially with luxury goods, was related to the very important excursion of the magi with special gifts to the Christ Child, conflating modern life with religious narrative. The subjects of the two interior wings, the Night Nativity and the Presentation in the Temple, are often found in Antwerp Mannerist triptychs. The Presentation in the Temple, not a featured subject in David’s oeuvre, was frequently connected with the Adoration of the Magi, especially in the oeuvre of the Master of 1518 and Pieter Coecke van Aelst, two of Antwerp’s most important painters.A record in the Antwerp Archives, published by Rombouts and Van Lerius in 1961, states that in 1515 Gerard David, the famous painter long-established in Bruges, joined the Guild of Saint Luke in Antwerp as a Master (Philippe Rombouts and Théodore François Xavier Van Lerius,De Liggeren en andere historisch archieven der Antwerpse St.-Lucasgilde, vol. 1, Amsterdam, 1961 [reprint of 1864–76 edition], p. 83).  Payments David continued to make on his house in Bruges in subsequent years imply that he did not move to Antwerp, and he did not take on any apprentices there, probably indicating that his workshop remained in Bruges. Most likely, David joined the Antwerp guild for commercial reasons, that is, in order to be able to sell paintings in what had become a more robust art market than Bruges at that time. This information is of particular interest in regard to The Met'sAdoration of the Magi.There are intriguing details of the facture of theAdorationthat reveal that David may well have maintained quality control over such triptychs that issued from his Bruges workshop for sale in Antwerp. Examination with infrared reflectography revealed that the figures and the architectural elements were underdrawn in a liquid medium with loose, summary strokes, in a style different than that characteristic of Gerard David (fig. 3). Here and there lines are broken with dashes, as if the artist was copying from a model. Although mostly painted by a workshop assistant, theAdorationshows that the treatment of the figures of the Virgin and Child and the two kneeling kings stand out from the rest for their far more refined handling and sensitive rendering, especially of the faces, as Micheline Comblen-Sonkes already noted (1983; unpublished opinion in departmental archives). The Virgin’s head is quite close stylistically and in terms of the paint handling to the head of the Virgin in David’s LondonAdoration of the Magi. The x-radiograph of the painting reveals significant differences in radio-opacity especially between the heads of the Virgin and eldest Magus, and the other figures (see Technical Notes and fig. 4). In addition, infrared reflectography shows that the features of the face of this Magus were significantly shifted in level and direction (fig. 3). This, added to the greater radio-opacity evident in the x-radiograph of the heads of the Virgin and eldest Magus, and the more refined handling and execution of both, suggest that a second hand, namely Gerard David, repainted these heads. He probably also painted the Christ Child and the second kneeling Magus. Such interventions by the master, which were not uncommon, before the painting left the workshop, guaranteed a certain level of quality for which Gerard David was well known, and perhaps helped to insure sales on the thriving and competitive open market in Antwerp (Ainsworth 2018).Maryan W. Ainsworth 2016",
        "Technical Notes": "Support:The support is composed of two oak planks, with the grain oriented vertically. The join, located at the center of the panel, was originally held in place with three dowels; evident in the x-radiograph (see fig. 4 above). Dendrochronological analysis indicated an earliest possible creation date of 1496, with a more plausible date of 1510 upward. The wood originated in the Baltic/Polish region (wood identification and dendrochronological analysis completed by Dr. Peter Klein, Universität Hamburg, 1997). The support has been planed to 1/4 inch (0.635 cm) and cradled.Preparation:The panel was prepared with an off-white ground. Unpainted margins and abarbealong all edges indicate that the panel was in an engaged frame when the ground was applied and that the original dimensions are preserved.Examination with infrared reflectography revealed that many of the figures and most of the architectural elements were underdrawn with a liquid medium (fig. 3). The underdrawn lines are generally angular and cursory, restricted to the most important contours. In several instances the lines become dashed, for example, along Joseph’s jawline and around his proper right eye, around the proper right eye of the Virgin and both eyes of the eldest magus. These dashed lines suggest an artist copying from a model, rather than drawing an original composition directly onto the prepared panel. Dashed and dotted underdrawn lines are also evident in the background.Comparison with the painted surface revealed many minor deviations from the underdrawing, including adjustments to contours and the repositioning of facial features.  In the background several corrections were made to angles in the architecture and the central tree was painted more vertically than the swaying trunk depicted in the underdrawing.Paint layers:There is a varying sophistication of handling throughout the composition. Some of the faces, most strikingly, the Virgin and the two kneeling magi, were more sensitively rendered than others. The distribution of light in these faces is more subtle and the features more finely described. A slightly different painting approach is exemplified in the eyes. The eyes of the courtier at far right and the black magus depend on contour lines that delineate the iris and the upper and lower lids, with a final—and occasionally inaccurate—touch of cool white to suggest the white of the eye (figs. 5–6). By contrast, the eyes of the eldest magus are less reliant on contour lines to create form; the whites of the eyes were modeled first, followed by a dab of green for the irises and then, while the paint was still wet, a single stroke of dark brown for the pupil and a touch of white for a highlight. Joseph’s eyes appear to have been painted following a similar method but some minor losses complicate this comparison (figs. 7–8). These differences in handling are subtle, but, when considered alongside other technical evidence, suggest the involvement of more than one hand.The head of the eldest magus and of the Virgin have a greater radio-opacity in the x-radiograph than the other heads (fig. 4). The head of the eldest magus appears as a nearly flat white oval in the x-radiograph: it is difficult to make out any of his facial features. This appearance could be due to a complete repainting of this head. On the other hand, the build-up of lead white in the Virgin’s head, as revealed in the x-radiograph is similar to that of the other figures and consistent with early Netherlandish painting practice, but it is simply more radio-opaque. The different appearance of the Virgin’s head in the x-radiograph may indicate that it was simply re-worked, resulting in the greater radio-opacity in the x-radiograph and the relatively thicker application of paint observed on the surface, rather than entirely painted out.Several changes, evident in infrared reflectography, also point to multiple hands at work. The eldest magus’s proper left eye was initially painted at a higher position, giving a steeper angle to the line of the eyes. Interestingly, the initial eye was painted slightly differently: the iris was outlined, like the eyes of the figures at right and unlike the final painted version. His mouth was also underdrawn at a steeper angle and altered in the painting. This evidence of significant changes to his facial features, together with the appearance of the magus’s head in the x-radiograph, further suggest that this head was entirely repainted and possibly by a different hand.  Infrared examination also revealed that Joseph’s proper right eye was originally painted higher, which would have given the angle of his eyes a steeper tilt downward as well. Finally, the Child’s head was enlarged slightly and painted out to the right, over the red of Joseph’s robe.In general the painting is in very good condition, with only a few areas of loss.  Losses are mostly associated with the join, as well as a few damages in the black magus’s green mantle. In addition the red robe of the courtier to the left of the black magus is slightly abraded. On the whole, the pigments making up the jewel-toned palette remain very vibrant: the red lakes are hardly faded and in the greens there is only a minor amount of discoloration, as is characteristic of copper-containing paint. There is some discoloration in the blue of the Virgin’s robe.The haloes of the Virgin and Child were originally executed using what appears to be shell gold, but it is quite damaged and has been heavily overpainted with a pale orange paint.Sophie Scully 2016Infrared reflectography completed with a Merlin Indigo InGaAs near infrared camera with a StingRay macro lens customized for the wavelengths covered by the camera, 0.9 to 1.7 microns.",

        "Intro Description": "First established in Bruges, Gerard David also joined the painter’s guild in Antwerp in 1515, where his compositions and motifs soon began to circulate. This excellently preserved panel is strongly indebted to David’s work. The extravagantly dressed onlookers, however, are a pure invention of Antwerp art, as is the landscape view with travelers carrying goods for trade. Due to Antwerp’s status as the mercantile center for Northern Europe, scenes of the Adoration of the Magi were particularly popular in the city. They served not only a devotional use, but could also be associated with the travel of foreign goods.",

        "Catalogue Entry": "A leading painter in eighteenth-century Rome, the Lucchese painter Pompeo Batoni was especially popular as a portraitist of milords on the Grand Tour. This picture was commissioned by Sir Humphry Morice shortly after his arrival in Rome in spring 1761: the artist’s receipt for the picture (for which, see Ashburnham 1793) reads as follows: \"Io sottoscritto mi obbligo a consegnar il qua / dro di Diana e Cupido a che mi pagherà / trecento zecchini il patto fatto con signor / Morice Inglese per il medesimo quadro / il primo di d'Aprile 1762 / Pompeo Batoni\" (I the undersigned oblige myself to consign the picture of Diana and Cupid to he who pays me 300 zecchini according to the agreement made with the Englishman Signor Morice for the same picture the first of April, 1762. Pompeo Batoni [see Bowron 1982]). In 1762 Morice then commissioned a full-length portrait showing himself reclining in the Roman countryside with three hounds and some game as a pendant (the original, dated 1762 or 1763, is in the collection of the late Sir Richard Graham, Norton Conyers, Yorkshire; an autograph replica is in the collection of Brinsley Ford [see Bowron 1982]). Diana is the goddess of the hunt, and the two pictures would have made effective pendants. In The Met's picture Diana holds Cupid's bow out of his reach, an action that is probably intended as a reproof, since Cupid's use of the bow was considered capricious and misdirected (Ovid,Metamorphoses, Book 1, lines 455ff.). The picture was highly praised in Rome and was considered the finest work by the artist (Bull 1787). Christiansen (1983) has noted its strongly Neoclassical design, with the Diana inspired by a famous Roman statue in the Vatican.

        "Intro Description": "Sir Humphrey Morice (1723–1785), son of a wealthy merchant and director of the Bank of England, commissioned this image of the goddess of hunting. It hung as a pendant, or companion piece, to Batoni’s portrait of Morice re-clining in the Roman countryside next to his dogs, rifle, and dead game. Together, the works contrast modern and ancient Rome in the manner of Giovanni Paolo Panini’s two canvases found nearby. Diana’s distinctive pose is based on a famous ancient statue of the sleeping Cretan princess Ariadne. Batoni inserts a literal tension into this otherwise staid composition with the elegantly lifted bow, which Diana withholds from Cupid.",

        "Artist:": "Philippe Pavy (French, 1856/57 or 1860–1891 Menton)",
        "Date:": "1886",
        "Medium:": "Oil on wood",
        "Dimensions:": "18 x 11 1/4 in. (45.7 x 28.6 cm)",

        "Object Number:": "2016.806",
        "Catalogue Entry": "The Artist:Most sources give Philippe Pavy’s year of birth as 1860 but provide no year of death. However, death notices published in 1891 state that he was then thirty-four years old, which would mean that he was born in 1856 or 1857. Pavy, sometimes called Pavy de Charentais, is known primarily by means of paintings, most of them depicting North African subjects, that appear on the art market. A pupil of Ernest Meissonier, Pavy was a fashionable artist but a minor figure, and is little studied. His brother, Eugène Pavy, was likewise an Orientalist painter. Early sources sometimes confuse Philippe and Eugène, but give the impression that Eugène was younger, perhaps suggesting that it was he who was born in 1860. The Pavy brothers’ family origins remain to be established with certainty.According to an unsigned news item in the Parisian newspaperLe Constitutionneldated December 14, 1886, Pavy spent a long period of time “en Orient et en Algérie” and had then lived in London for ten years. There is scant evidence of Philippe Pavy as a participant in exhibitions other than in London, where, between about 1874 and 1883, he showed at the Royal Academy of Arts and, more frequently, at the Society of British Artists. His name was occasionally rendered in English, as Philip E. Pavy, Esq. Writing in theMagazine of Art, a critic reviewing the exhibition held at the Society of British Artists in January 1883 praised Pavy’s paintings for their “unobtrusive style, their thorough but nevertheless artistic treatment of details, and their marked richness and variety of colour” (p. 10). This description may appear to be so low-key as to convey little, but it is accurate, as Pavy employed a largely academic technique (“unobtrusive style”) with a lively touch (“artistic treatment of details”).The Painting:A girl stands leaning on a pilaster that borders, on the left, a wall with turned woodwork below and masonry above, and, on the right, a fountain. Her proper right leg is crossed before her left. Her fingers are intertwined on top of her head, with elbows out on either side of long, dark hair. Her eyes are downcast, gazing at pigeons by her feet. A brass brazier with its pan appear on the left. The brushwork is delicate yet painterly.Most of the details of the girl’s garments, as well as the architectural elements, derive from Algerian sources. This girl, wearing the same clothes and in the same pose, appears in a photograph produced in 1884 or earlier and retailed by the Algiers studio of Jean Geiser (Swiss, 1848–1923). The photo, which served as Pavy’s primary source, is annotated in the plate “Aïcha, jeune mauresque d’Alger.”[1] The fountain is based on one in the courtyard of the Admiralty at Algiers, early photographs of which also exist, though the building is inaccessible to the public today. Incorporating early faïence tiles and decorative marble panels, it was installed in 1765 by Baba-Ali Neskis, known as Bou-Sebâ, Dey of Algiers from 1754 to 1766.[2] There are also comparable examples of open woodwork in the Admiralty. Pavy’s composition is a pastiche of these sources, to which the painter added details such as the jewelry. As proposed by Emily Weeks (2008), the subject of an Arab girl with pigeons at her feet may have been inspired by William Holman Hunt’sThe Afterglow in Egypt, painted about 1854–63 (Southampton Art Gallery, SOTAG:1280).Where Pavy painted this work and his sources for additional details, including the colors he employed, are unknown. However, the artist appears to have taken liberties with the identification of the scene, as attested by inscriptions on the back of the panel, including the given title,Courtyard in Tanger[sic], whose calligraphy matches that of the signature and the date inscribed on the face of the painting.[3]Taken together, these elements reveal the artist’s approach to producing an image whose subject is layered—but also hidden, the result of the casual or possibly deliberate misidentification of the location he depicted. In this way, Pavy’s creative process as it intersects with his construction of meaning contribute to a general understanding of Orientalist picture-making. Pavy later adapted the same figure for a painting in which she leans against a wall beside an elderly man.[4]Asher Miller 2024Identifications of the elements in this painting were communicated by Ikram Moumen, to whom the author is immensely grateful. Further information about the album of photographs by Geiser was graciously forwarded by Sylvie Aubenas and Olivier Loiseaux.[1] A print of this photograph is included as plate 57 in [2 albums et 101 phot. d'Algérie, principalement sites et types ethniques, portraits de Si Mohammed Belkassem, marabout de El Ham... (?) et de Mohammed Srir, fils du cadi de Biskra, en 1884], collection of the Société de Géographie in the Bibliothèque Nationale de France, Paris.[2] See Henri Klein, “Les fontaines mauresques,”Feuillets d'El-Djezaïr, 1937, p. 184.[3] Signed and dated (lower right): PHILIP.

        "Intro Description": "In the 1870s and 80s, Pavy exhibited scenes like this one at the Society of British Arts and the Royal Academy of Arts in London, where they were praised for their \"unobtrusive style, their thorough but nevertheless artistic treatment of details, and their marked richness and variety of color.\" However, although Pavy titled this pictureCourtyard in Tangier, it is based on a photograph of a girl named Aïcha, produced and retailed in Algiers by the studio of Jean Geiser (Swiss, 1848–1923). Evidently the painter’s skill at rendering humans and objects convincingly was not alloyed to a strict sense of veracity overall.",

        "Notes": "Alphonse Promayet was a private teacher for a branch of the Romanoff family in Russia, but later returned to France.There are two or three other portraits of Promayet by Courbet, one of them a drawing (F20 under Drawings; Paris, Musée du Louvre). Another was listed in the Courbet exhibition of 1882 (École des Beaux-Arts, May 1882, no. 159) as belonging to Granet, 79 x 62 cm, without a signature or date. Huyghe, Bazin, and Adhémar (1944) also mention a smaller bust-length portrait then belonging to André Derain, which might be the Granet version cut down. No portrait of Promayet other than the drawing and The Met's painting is catalogued by Fernier or currently known. Based on this conflicting and incomplete information, identification of the paintings in the three exhibitions of 1855, 1857, and 1867 cannot be determined.Alphonse Promayet is also depicted in Courbet'sAfter Dinner at Ornans(F92; Palais des Beaux-Arts, Lille),Burial at Ornans(F91; Musée d'Orsay, Paris), andThe Artist's Studio(F165; Musée d'Orsay, Paris).",
        "Intro Description": "Promayet, a violinist who was a childhood friend and schoolmate of Courbet's, appears in several paintings by the artist. Here, he holds his instrument while adopting a soulful expression befitting a struggling musician. This picture served as the model for Promayet's likeness inThe Painter’s Studioof 1855 (Musée d'Orsay, Paris). Courbet borrowed it back from the sitter, as he did many other portraits used for the life-size canvas.",
