        "Intro Description": "Guardi’s views of Venice were hugely popular among eighteenth-century visitors to the city, but not all were by the artist himself: his workshop reproduced compositions and motifs based on his earlier paintings and drawings, while emulators took advantage of the market for the taste he had helped to set. These pendants include several elements known from Guardi’s drawings and were most likely executed by assistants in his studio, working on the modest scale that was perfectly suited to customers seeking a souvenir but not the financial commitment of a large painting by the master.",

        "Title:": "The Flight into Egypt",
        "Artist:": "Giovanni Battista Tiepolo (Italian, Venice 1696–1770 Madrid)",
        "Date:": "ca. 1767–70",
        "Medium:": "Oil on canvas",
        "Dimensions:": "23 5/8 × 16 1/4 in. (60 × 41.3 cm)",

        "Object Number:": "2019.141.19",
        "Catalogue Entry": "The Flight into Egypt, based on the Gospel of Saint Matthew (2:13–15), was a favorite subject of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century painters, and Tiepolo was no exception. In fact, he was the last great master to explore the theme. Throughout his career he was drawn to the subject, treating it in one of his earliest paintings (about 1720), now in the Fine Arts Gallery, San Diego, California; in six pen-and-ink drawings (ca. 1735) from the dismembered album that once belonged to Prince Alexis Orloff; and in the altarpiece (about 1745) in the small church of Santi Massimo e Osvaldo in Padua. He executed the present canvas, and three other closely related paintings of the Flight and the Rest on the Flight, during the very last years of his life.In a rocky landscape, the Virgin, Saint Joseph, and a donkey stare at a guardian angel, who prostrates himself on the ground before them on the bank of a river (probably the Jordan or the Nile) that they have just crossed. The boatman bows his head in reverence; in the lower right there is a stone with an illegible inscription. The related canvases (see Notes) variously show the Holy Family in a boat punted across the river by the angel (Museu Nacional de Art Antiga, Lisbon); pausing on the crest of a hill overlooking a city reminiscent of Madrid (Bellagio Study and Conference Center); and resting in a menacing mountain landscape (Staatsgalerie Stuttgart).Tiepolo’s red and white chalk drawing of a donkey in three positions (Christie’s, New York, January 28, 2020, lot 70) links several of these canvases: the animal at left appears in The Met and Stuttgart paintings, the middle animal in the Bellagio and Lisbon paintings (in the latter it appears in reverse orientation–notably the verso of the drawing includes a black chalk tracing of the outline used in this painting).The four canvases recall the suite of twenty-four etchings by Tiepolo’s son Domenico that were gathered in an album titledIdee pittoresche sopra la fuga in Egitto(Picturesque Ideas on the Flight into Egypt), published in 1753 with a dedication to the prince-bishop of Würzburg (see Russell 1972, nos. 59–92). Following the accounts of the Flight into Egypt in theGolden Legendand the Apocrypha of the New Testament, Domenico’s etchings show Saint Joseph rousing his young wife and child from their comfortable Venetian-looking quarters, escaping with them at night from a stable where they picked up a donkey, traveling overland and across bodies of water, and finally reaching the safety of a walled town. Some writers believe Tiepolo’s four canvases formed a similar set, perhaps intended for the decoration of a small chapel (Morassi 1962, Pedrocco 1993, Giacometti 1994). This is unlikely, even though all four are almost exactly the same size and share the same handling and mood, because the protagonists are depicted inconsistently: Saint Joseph, for example, appears as a young man in the Bellagio canvas and as an old man in the Lisbon and Met pictures. Most likely the paintings are variations on a theme, similar to Tiepolo’s countless sketches of the Holy Family that show his inexhaustible inventiveness (Brown 1993, Christiansen 1996). In fact, although the four works were probably sold individually, they were undoubtedly conceived as sequential episodes and brilliantly exhibit Tiepolo’s narrative approach to subject matter.The dating of the painting to near the end of Tiepolo’s life is confirmed by the affinity of its style to that of his modelli for the altarpieces of San Pascual Baylon (Courtauld Gallery, London) as well as by the similarities of the composition to those of a pair of small canvases from Tiepolo’s Spanish period, theAnnunciationandAbraham Visited by Angels(collection of the duquesa de Villahermosa at Pedrola, near Zaragoza). The poses of the statuesque Virgin and the prostrate angel in The Met's canvas echo those of the Virgin, angels, and Abraham in the Villahermosa pictures. They share, moreover, the same silvery tonality and trembling yet sure handling of paint that distinguish Tiepolo’s final easel paintings.[2019; adapted from Fahy 2005]",

It combines an innovative, asymmetrical composition that takes advantage of empty space and a cool palette animated with quivering outlines of the landscape, rockface, prostrate angel, and Holy Family. The Virgin is monumental as she protectively enwraps her son, far exceeding the work’s modest scale. The family has just disembarked from a boat that ferried them across the Nile river, though this imaginary topography seems more inspired by the Alps than by Egypt.",

        "Notes": "Narcisa Barañana de Goicoechea was the wife of Juan Bautista de Goicoechea y Urrutia, a distant relative of Gumersinda Goicoechea, who married Goya's son Javier in 1805. The costume worn by the sitter is that of a \"maja,\" or young woman of the Spanish working class. Similar dress is shown in Goya's portraits of the Duchess of Alba, 1797 (Hispanic Society, New York), Amalia Bonells de Costa, 1803–6 (Detroit Institute of Arts), and in theQueen María Luisa in a Mantillaof 1799 (Palacio Real, Madrid). In the pendant to this portrait (111.5 x 80 cm, Staatliche Kunsthalle, Karlsruhe), Juan Bautista wears the Order of Charles III, which he received in 1815, the same year he was appointed Minister of War to Ferdinand VII. Our painting, then, may date between 1805 and 1815.Although previously accepted as autograph, the attribution of this painting is now questioned.",
        "Intro Description": "This painting first came to light in 1900, when it was lent to the large Goya exhibition in Madrid as the pendant to a portrait of the sitter's husband, Juan Bautista de Goicoechea y Urrutia. Juan Bautista was appointed Minister of War to Ferdinand VII in 1815 and in his portrait (now in the Staatliche Kunsthalle, Karlesruhe) wears the order of Charles III, received in the same year. He was apparently distantly related to Gumersinda Goicoechea, who married Goya's son Javier in 1805. Our portrait may have been painted close to the time of Javier's marriage, but was certainly executed by 1815/16.Despite the signature on the ring—a favorite device of Goya's—the attribution of this portrait has recently been questioned by some authorities.",

        "Catalogue Entry": "For a century untilSpring Morningreappeared at auction in 1981, its composition was known only through the related drypoint (see Notes). It was common practice for Tissot not only to repeat his paintings as etchings, but to re-use and re-combine figures, motifs, costumes, and compositions. Indeed, elements of this painting served as the sources for a number of works. The dress reappears in the etchingWoman at the Window(ca. 1875) and again with the hat in the paintingHolyday(ca. 1876; Tate, London); the rhubarb plant and reeds in the foreground are featured in the paintingThe Widower(1876; Art Gallery of New South Wales, Melbourne) as well as in the related etching; the reeds appear again in the similar composition ofThe Orphan(1879; private collection).The motif of the figure silhouetted against the light is reminiscent of certain Japanese color woodblock prints, such as Buncho Ippitsusai’sThe Actor Segawa Kikunojo in a Female Role(ca. 1796), and the clump of vegetation in the foreground is similar to a motif in Hokusai’sManga, sources which were available to Tissot throughout the 1860s (as pointed out by Michael Wentworth,James Tissot: Catalogue Raisonné of his Prints, exh. cat., Minneapolis, 1978, where these images are reproduced as figs. 13a and 13b, respectively). Tissot, along with his friends Baudelaire, Bracquemond, Degas, Fantin-Latour, Manet, Monet, and Whistler, was an early and avid afficionado of the Japanese color prints that began to arrive in France in the late 1850s and early 1860s. Nevertheless, Tissot may also have been inspired by the sight of related motifs in the works of his contemporaries, where a similar contre-jour effect may be seen, as in the example of Monet’sGladioli(1876; Detroit Institute of Arts; see Wentworth 1978, p. 79, fig. 13c). Most of the Impressionist artists employed this effect at one point or another in the 1870s and 1880s.When the etching derived from this painting was exhibited in London in 1876, it was inexplicably singled out for criticism as \"intensely vulgar, but clever enough for the public it appeals to.\" (Anonymous, \"Exhibition of Works in Black and White – Dudley Gallery,\"Athenaeum, no. 2538 [June 17, 1876], p. 837, as quoted in Wentworth 1978, p. 76 n. 3, under no. 13). The vulgarity that offended the critic was perhaps the direct, unmitigated stare of the model, addressing the viewer from across a small pond. But there is nothing vulgar about her gesture, her dress, nor the garden. It is not known whether Tissot portrayed a specific garden (perhaps his own in St. John’s Wood) or invented an imaginary one, but the remarkable specificity of the blooming plants—acanthus and iris in the foreground, red pelargoniums, white azaleas, and rhododendrons in the background—suggests a setting in late spring, perhaps June.It is possible that this is the earliest representation of Tissot’s companion Kathleen Newton. According to Newton’s niece Lilian Hervey, \"One day [Tissot] called to ask if he might paint her portrait. Over sittings they fell deeply in love, and soon Mrs. Newton went to live with Tissot.\" (Quoted by Marita Ross in \"The Truth About Tissot,\"Everybody’s Weekly, June 15, 1946, p. 6.) The details of Newton’s life in the years which immediately preceded her moving in with Tissot sometime in 1876 are unknown. Given that in March of that year she gave birth to a son, Cecil George, who could have been fathered by Tissot (there is no evidence either way), the present painting may document an early phase of their relationship.

        "Intro Description": "The light on this spring day is so bright that the woman shields her eyes from the glare. She stands with her back to the sun, so that her face and dress are largely in shadow. This contre-jour effect, with the figure lit from behind, was popular with artists in the Impressionist circle in the 1870s and 1880s. Tissot skillfully elaborated on the motif by depicting the sunlight shining through the model’s sleeve and parasol. The strong silhouette of the figure and the prominent plants may have been inspired by Japanese woodblock prints, which Tissot collected, as did his friends Monet and Degas.",

        "Notes": "The Prince of Asturias was sixteen when Goya painted his sketch for theFamily of Charles IV(1800; Prado, Madrid). He is shown wearing the Spanish Habsburg Order of the Golden Fleece, the French Bourbon Order of the Holy Spirit, and the sash of the Spanish Order of Charles III.Once viewed as a copy, this picture is now considered the original full-scale oil sketch for the large group portrait, later transformed into a finished painting by another hand. From Goya's account (see Cipriano Muñoz y Manzano, Conde de la Viñaza,Goya, su tiempo, su vida, sus obras, Madrid, 1887, p. 215) and from a June 9, 1800, letter from Queen María Luisa, we know that he made ten studies for the principal figures at Aranjuez, the summer residence of the royal family. An 1808 inventory of the Royal Palace mentions seven studies without identifying them individually, and an 1814 inventory identifies nine studies, including one of Ferdinand VII (see José Luis Sanco, \"Francisco de Goya y Fréderic Quilliet en el Palacio Real de Madrid, 1808,\"Boletin del Museo del Prado19 [2001], p. 120; and Mena Marqués et. al. 2002, pp. 195, 240]. Five of the original studies are, without doubt, those now in the Prado. Four others, including this one, were at one time in the collection of the dukes of Montpensier, Palace of San Telmo, Seville, before being scattered among various collections. The other three former Montpensier portraits are of King Charles IV (private collection, Paris), Queen María Luisa (Taft Museum, Cincinnati) and the Infanta María Isabel (private collection, Paris).Another portrait sketch of Ferdinand VII as Prince of Asturias (52 x 39 cm) was published in a 1988 catalogue of Stair Sainty Matthiesen Gallery, New York, as sold to a private collector. A version in a private collection, Brussels, is mentioned in the literature, but not illustrated (see Mayer 1923, no. 107; Gaya Nuño 1958, no. 983; Morales y Marin 1994, p. 271).",
        "Intro Description": "The sixteen-year-old Prince of Asturias wears the Spanish Habsburg Order of the Golden Fleece, the French Bourbon Order of the Holy Spirit, and the sash of the Spanish Order of Charles III. Once viewed as a copy, the picture is now considered the original, full-scale oil sketch for Goya’s famous group portrait of the family of King Charles IV (Museo del Prado, Madrid). Like the other surviving studies for that work, attention focused on the head while the bust and costume were left unfinished. Subsequently another artist gave it a finished appearance and painted the oval surround. The picture belonged the sitter’s widow and to the dukes of Montpensier.",

        "Catalogue Entry": "The Subject:The story of Erminia is recounted inJerusalem Delivered, Torquato Tasso's epic poem of the First Crusade published in 1581 (VII, xix). Having fallen in love with the Christian knight Tancredi and having fled to the forest after being attacked by soldiers, Princess Erminia takes refuge with shepherds. There, \"when underneath the greenwood shade / Her flocks lay hid from Phoebus’ scorching rays, / Unto her knight she songs and sonnets made, / And them engraved in bark of beech and bays . . . . \" (trans. Edward Fairfax, London, 1600). In the picture she is shown carving on the trunk of a tree. Interestingly, above her—out of reach—are two letters that the artist drew in ink: apparently \"I N\".The Picture and its Attribution:The picture, frequently described as \"unfinished,\" is of unusual interest and importance for our understanding of the transformations in landscape painting in early seventeenth-century Rome—a period in which a renewed attention to the study of nature and an interest in the effects of light at various times of day intersected with the Venetian tradition of an idealized pastoral landscape. Northern painters played a conspicuous role in this story: the Fleming Paul Bril (1554–1626), who enjoyed enormous prestige in Rome, where he worked from 1583 onward; the German Adam Elsheimer (1578–1610), whose exquisite, small-scale landscapes lay new ground and were enormously influential; another German, Goffredo Wals (1595–1638; see1997.157), who built on the example of Elsheimer; and the Frenchman Claude Lorrain (1604/5?–1682), one of the greatest landscape painters of Western art. Claude spent time with Wals; both artists had worked with the Italian Agostino Tassi (1578–1644), who was prominent as an expert in architectural perspective (quadratura) and in landscape painting (these two aspects of his work come together in his decorations for a room in Palazzo Odescalchi, then the property of Cardinal Ludovisi; see Cavazzini 2008, pp. 57–59). Thus it is not surprising that this enchanting panel has been ascribed alternatively to both Tassi and Claude (see References).Technical Features:The picture is on a poplar panel one inch thick. The composition was laid in very summarily with a brush drawing in ink. The preparatory drawing (or underdrawing) can be seen in places through the paint but is only modestly enhanced by infrared reflectography since it is evidently in bistre or iron gall (see figs. 1–4 above). This technique is analogous to what is found in the informal nature studies that Tassi and Claude carried out in ink on paper: quick, calligraphic, with very little modeling. In the picture, the outline of the distant mountain is easily detected, as are a few scalloped lines for the clouds, loops for the backs of the sheep; long lines for the trees—where there is some occasional curved hatching to indicate modeling (visible especially in the trunk of the tree to the far right); and indications for the foliage (best seen above the horizon at the far right). Analogies for the draftsmanship may be found in the graphic output of both Tassi and Claude. However, where those artists—and particularly Claude—would have then proceeded with ink washes to describe the play of light over the features of the landscape, here color was laid on in broadly brushed bands. At the right, the green was brushed in a vertical direction with almost no modeling. Elsewhere, as in the middle ground, the brushstrokes are horizontal and describe a succession of planes. The figure of Erminia was painted over the landscape—as though an interpolation to give what was a pure landscape view a classical subject. The figure is notable both for the summary treatment and the beautiful suggestion of light playing over the back of her neck and illuminating her arm. By contrast, the foliage of the trees is more densely painted and may properly be described as \"finished.\" Everything else remains in a state that is perhaps best described as informal. There is, in other words, no reason to think that it was the artist’s intention to bring the work to a higher degree of finish, and to describe it as \"unfinished\"—signifying \"incomplete\"—is in this sense a misnomer.Claude and Plein-Air Painting in Seventeenth-Century Rome:The rapid, summary execution brings to mind two famous remarks regarding Claude’s study of nature. The first occurs in Joachim Sandrart’s biography (Der Teutschen Academie zweyter Theil, 1675) in which he recounts how Claude \"tried by every means to penetrate nature, lying in the fields before the break of day and until night in order to learn to represent very exactly the red morning-sky, sunrise and sunset and the evening hours. When he had well contemplated one or the other in the fields, he immediately prepared his colours accordingly, returned home and applied them to the work he had in mind with much greater naturalness than anyone had ever done.\" Later, after meeting Sandrart, Claude took up \"painting from life in the field. But while I was only looking for good rocks, trunks, trees, cascades, buildings, and ruins which were great and suited me as a fillers for history paintings, he on the other hand only painted, on a small scale, the view from the middle to the greatest distance, fading away towards the horizon and the sky, a type in which he was a master . . . .\" (translation: Marcel Röthlisberger,Claude Lorrain: The Paintings, New Haven, 1961, vol. 1, p. 48). The other remark was made on the occasion of a visit in August of 1647 by André Félibien, who records in his journal that  \"I saw Claude Lorrain and his small landscapes painted in tempera (détrempe) on wood. First it is necessary to put on a very delicate layer of glue (colle de gand), then paint, the colors having been diluted in the glue; or, alternatively, take an egg—the yoke and white—with a bit of vinegar and the same amount of water and the sap from the branches of a fig tree, and beat them together, and use this instead of the glue, gum Arabic (la gomme) not being good [for this purpose] because everything will curdle\" (see Y. Delaporte, \"André Félibien en italie,\"Gazette des beaux-arts51 [April 1958], pp. 205–6; discussed in Rand 2011, p. 47). It was Félibien’s remark, evidently inspired by his curiosity at an unusual technique, that led Röthlisberger (1983) to attribute The Met’s picture to Claude and to date it to 1647, though on stylistic grounds a dating in the 1630s seems more likely. Cavazzini (2008), who has argued that the picture is more likely to be by Tassi, dates it to about 1632, and this seems more or less convincing regardless of which of the two artists is held responsible. The technique would appear to be one Claude adapted from painting on paper. Perhaps not coincidentally, it was in the years around 1630 that Sandrart and Claude met and that Claude adopted his practice of painting outside. Röthlisberger has noted that Claude’s post mortem inventory lists eight small pictures on panel; the only other work on panel ascribed to him is aFlight into Egyptin the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute, Williamstown.The Attribution:The relevance of these accounts is of great interest for our evaluation of this landscape as well as, obviously, for the history of plein air landscape painting. The picture might be understood as reflecting this early practice of studying nature and then rushing back to the studio to record those impressions. Whether Tassi, like Claude, embraced this practice is not known, but there is no reason to think that he did not. If the landscape with a scene of witchcraft in the Walters Art Gallery, Baltimore is by Tassi, as seems to be the case, then he was capable of works of this quality. A drawing related in subject and penmanship in the Harvard Art Museums (1979.231) comes from an album of Tassi’s and supports an attribution of The Met’s picture to Tassi rather than to Claude (see Patrizia Cavazzini, \"Agostino Tassi Reassessed: A Newly Discovered Album of Drawings,\"Paragone51, July 2000, p. 20; also see fig. 5).

        "Catalogue Entry": "Rembrandt's lateFlorawas probably painted about 1654. The facial features recall Rembrandt's wife, Saskia (died 1642), and to a lesser extent presumed representations of his companion, Hendrickje Stoffels, but there was certainly no intention of depicting either woman here. The figure is an ideal type that goes back to earlier pictures by Rembrandt.It is often observed that in this picture Rembrandt emulates Titian, in particular his beautifulFloraof ca. 1515–20 (Galleria degli Uffizi, Florence), which until 1641 was in Amsterdam for a few years. The same canvas has been connected, unconvincingly, with Rembrandt'sFloraof 1634 (State Hermitage Museum, St. Petersburg) and, more plausibly, with hisFloraof 1635 (National Gallery, London). The subject of Flora and the closely related theme of Arcadian shepherdesses flourished in the artist's circle during the 1630s, and The Met's picture may be described as a mature restatement of an image that had attracted Rembrandt when he was in his late twenties and newly married. In a broad view, the legacy of Venetian art in a picture such as this one is its treatment of an imaginary figure in terms of real experience. Here one finds a woman from the mythological past depicted with a sensual and emotional immediacy rarely achieved before. Rembrandt's study of human expression and behavior had begun in Leiden nearly thirty years earlier, but here it is more subjective and more sensitive.Two portraits of Saskia seem especially important for The Met'sFlora: theSaskia as Floraof 1641 in the Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister, Staatliche Kunstsammlungen, Dresden, and the profile portrait of Saskia in a luxurious version of Northern Renaissance costume in the Gemäldegalerie, Kassel, which is thought to have been begun about 1634, finished about 1642, and sold to Jan Six in October 1652. The offer of a carnation in the Museum's picture may be traced back in Rembrandt's oeuvre mainly to his silverpoint drawing of Saskia dated \"the third day of our betrothal, the 8th of June 1633\" (Kupferstichkabinett, Berlin), and to theSaskia as Florain Dresden. Although carnations and roses, like any flowers, were attributes of Flora, they also had a long history in art and literature as signs of love and marriage. Rembrandt seems to recall Netherlandish tradition as well as Renaissance images of the goddess \"in the mantle of Spring,\" scattering flowers from her folded gown (Held 1961).The painting has suffered from linings and abrasion. The trace of horizontal threads in the paint layer is especially pronounced to the right in the bust and sleeve. Modeling is diminished in the head and neck. The background is quite thin; an early repainting of the background, noted by Bode in 1901, was removed in the 1970s. The intended wall plane, with various textures and light effects, is now only vaguely discerned. The voluminous sleeves of the Venetian chemise have lost some degree of the gracefulness and much of the substance they once had. X-radiographs (see fig. 1 above) give an idea of the billowing volumes and flowing forms that were originally found in the blouse, skirt, and apron, creating a vivid impression of space filled by a figure with arms extended toward the viewer as well as to the side.[2011; adapted from Liedtke 2007]",

        "Notes": "Etched by A. Pond (Smith 1836).",
        "Intro Description": "Unlike many of his ambitious contemporaries, Rembrandt never traveled to Italy. Nonetheless, Italian art had a profound effect on him. In this depiction of the Roman goddess of spring, he responded to the sixteenth-century Venetian master Titian in particular. Still, the somber coloration and rough paint handling make this work unmistakably Rembrandt’s own, and the goddess may be based in part on a portrait of his late wife, Saskia, who had been the inspiration for many of his paintings.",

        "Catalogue Entry": "Fernando Yáñez de la Almedina was a key figure in laying the groundwork for Renaissance painting in Spain. The first certain notice of him is in September 1506, when, together with his contemporary Fernando Llanos (active 1506–16), he was advanced payment for work on an altarpiece (retablo) dedicated to Saints Cosmas and Damian for the cathedral of Valencia. The two artists collaborated on other projects, including the same cathedral’s main altarpiece (retablo mayor), in 1507–10. In 1515 Yáñez traveled briefly to Barcelona, returned to Valencia by 1516, and in 1518–21 was working in his native Almedina in southeastern Spain. Between 1525 and 1531 he worked in Cuenca, before returning to Almedina, where he is documented from 1532 until 1537. Yáñez clearly spent time in Italy prior to his highly successful career in Spain and he rather than Llanos is usually identified with the \"Ferrando Spagnuolo\" who in April and August of 1505 collected money for work with Leonardo da Vinci on a mural depicting the battle of Anghiari in the Palazzo della Signoria in Florence (\"Ferrando Spagnolo, dipintore, per dipinguere con Lionardo da Vinci nella sala del consiglio florine 5 larghi e a Thomaso di Giovane Merini, su garzone per macinare e colori, florini 1 in oro\"; see Benito et al.,Los Hernandos, pintores hispanos del entorno de Leonardo, Museo de Bellas Artes de Valencia, 1998, p. 18). Besides Florence, he must also have spent time in northern Italy, where perhaps not coincidentally Leonardo was active prior to his return in Florence in February 1503. This remains highly speculative, however, and is based purely on the stylistic features of Yáñez’s documented work in Spain. The most thorough as well as convincing reconstruction of his early activity in Italy is that of Ibáñez Martínez (1999, pp. 221–40), who rejects earlier conjectures and attributions and considers The Met’s picture one of two done in Italy by the artist under the influence of Leonardo da Vinci.The attribution of The Met’s picture to Yáñez was first proposed by Checa Cremades (1992), who noted that a painting in a private collection in Madrid showing Christ flanked by Saints Peter and John shows the same use of gold dots in the halo and an identical decoration of medallions with Christ’s monogram (IHS) and rinceaux; the beards in both pictures also have the same form. That work is a touchstone of Yáñez’s work at its finest. Since the inscriptions identifying the two apostles are written in Spanish, it was presumably either painted for a Spanish patron resident in Italy or, more likely, in Valencia.The Met’s picture, which is painted on poplar, is less well preserved than the above-mentioned picture, especially in the beard. It also shows a greater degree of naturalism in its physiognomic description and intensity in the gaze. In this it is particularly indebted to the example of northern painting and suggests a parallel development to the work of Lorenzo Lotto, who was deeply influenced by Dürer’s two trips to Venice (1494–95 and 1505–7).Bust-length depictions of Christ—both in painting and sculpture—were relatively common in fifteenth- and sixteenth-century Italy and Spain. They relate to reputedly miraculous paintings derived from the image of Christ’s face that was said to have been imprinted on a cloth when a follower, Veronica, wiped his face on the way to Calvary, or a famous image, the Mandylion of Edessa, which was brought to France following the sack of Constantinople in 1204. A fine fourteenth-century depiction of Veronica’s veil, by the Florentine Master of the Orcagnesque Misericordia, is in The Metropolitan Museum (1981.365.2). Christ was also shown bust-length, crowned with thorns: see the Museum’s paintings by Petrus Christus (60.71.1) and Antonello da Messina (32.100.82). In yet another variant he was shown holding an orb as the Salvator Mundi: see the Museum’s painting by Albrecht Dürer (32.100.64). The latter type is especially relevant as Leonardo da Vinci painted just such an image (for which, see Luke Syson inLeonardo da Vinci: Painter at the Court of Milan, exh. cat., National Gallery, London, 2011, pp. 281–83). Images such as these were intended for private devotion and the intent gaze of Christ can be seen as an effective device to both address and engage the viewer. The Met’s picture has been dated to about 1505.Keith Christiansen 2014",

        "Frame": "The frame is from central Spain and dates to about 1580–90 (see figs. 1–3 above). The delicatecassettamolding is made of pine and retains its original mitred face lap joints. The profile progresses from the sight edge outward in a series of ogee, steps, ovolo, and hollows with a frieze within. The surface, also original, is mordant gilded on the moldings and painted black on the frieze and top edge over a thin ground. The Latin text in gold: “Formosissima Es Maria, Ave Salutis Mater, Puerpera Pulcherrima Salve, Tu Mihi Sola Places” is a salutation to the Virgin Mary. Undoubtedly this frame was conceived for a portrait of her. Heraldic shields in the lower corners painted over the gilt decoration suggest specific family ownership in the past. The frame is from the collection and was put on the painting in 2014.Timothy Newbery with Cynthia Moyer 2017; further information on this frame can be found in the Department of European Paintings files",
        "Intro Description": "The mesmerizing expression and distant gaze of Jesus would have made this a particularly effective painting for private devotion. Yáñez spent time in Italy, where he worked with Leonardo da Vinci, returning to his native Spain in 1506. The delicate play of light across the face and the description of the curling hair and beard reflect that experience, while the emphasis on gold ornamentation is more typically Spanish. The frame is of the period and Spanish but not original to the picture; it creates the effect of a window onto a sacred realm.",

His formative influences in the 1820s—Gericault, Delacroix, and Bonington—are felt not in his topographical work, however, but in freely painted oil sketches such as this one. While these works reveal Isabey’s deep roots in Romanticism, they also seem to anticipate Impressionism, yet the artist played no role in the movement.",

        "Notes": "The picure depicts Saint Thomas twice: on the left he takes a book from a shelf, and on the right he is seated between Saints Paul and Peter, who have appeared to him in order to explain a passage in Isaiah. The monk shown at the upper left is probably Brother Rinaldo, to whom Saint Thomas dictated the exposition (see Acta Sanctorum, Martii, vol. 1, 1865, p. 668).The panel is one of a group of perhaps nine scenes that originally surrounded an image of Saint Thomas Aquinas. The altarpiece was painted for a chapel in the church of San Domenico, Modena. The central panel is lost, but at least five other scenes depicting the life of Saint Thomas are known:The Birth of Saint Thomas (Yale University Art Gallery, New Haven)Saint Thomas at the Court of King Louis (formerly private collection; sold, Drouot-Richelieu, Audap & Mirabaud, commissaires-priseurs, Paris, November 15, 2013, no. 22)The Debate with the Heretic and Christ Approving Saint Thomas's Work (de Young Museum, San Francisco)The Vision of Fra Paolino dell'Aquila (de Young Museum, San Francisco)The Preaching of Saint Thomas (National Gallery of Art, Washington)Two more scenes may be part of this group:The Childhood of Saint Thomas (formerly Schweitzer collection; sold, Christie's, New York, January 11, 1979, no. 53)The Death of Saint Thomas (Moravská Galerie, Brno)San Domenico once contained three altarpieces by Bartolomeo, dedicated to Saints Dominic, Thomas Aquinas, and Vincent Ferrer; a fourth altarpiece dedicated to Peter Martyr (signed and dated by Simone Lamberti, 1450) is now in the Galleria Nazionale, Parma (no. 499).",
        "Intro Description": "The great Dominican theologian Saint Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274) is shown twice: consulting a book, and seated between Saints Peter and Paul, who miraculously appeared to help him interpret sacred texts. The narrative is mentioned in Aquinas’s first biography, written by William of Tocco, a Dominican prior who was part of the effort to promote his canonization. The panel belongs to an altarpiece painted for a chapel in the church of San Domenico in Modena. Bartolomeo degli Erri and his brother Agnolo were the key artistic personalities in Modena during the second half of the fifteenth century and painted three altarpieces for the church of San Domenico.",

        "Catalogue Entry": "Diziani, born in Belluno early in 1689, was reportedly sent to Venice for further study at the age of twenty. In due course he entered the Venice atelier of the Bellunese Gregorio Lazzarini, and later that of Sebastiano Ricci, by whom he was chiefly influenced. The French critic and connoisseur Pierre Jean Mariette states that for several years Diziani worked abroad, first in Munich, in 1717, and thereafter in Dresden. The artist returned to Venice no later than 1720 as he is listed in the \"Fraglia dei pittori di Venezia\" from 1720 to 1726. From time to time he is recorded in his native Belluno and he also visited Rome, but for the greater part of the balance of his life he remained in Venice, working there and in the surrounding region. Much of Diziani’s site-specific work is still in situ. Early in his career he had been a scenographer, though nothing survives of his production in this genre, and he was also a gifted and prolific draftsman.The Met’s painting by Diziani entered the collection as part of the decoration of the principal bedroom of Palazzo Sagredo on the Grand Canal in Venice, which was bought in its entirety and moved from the palace to New York in 1906 (06.1335.1a–d). The room belonged to a small private suite on two floors joined by private staircases, all decorated in the same extravagant style, and the wood- and plasterwork in one of them, dated 1718, is signed by the Swiss-bornstuccatoriAbbondio Stazio and his assistant Carpoforo Mazzetti Tencalla. It was at first assumed that the ceiling painting was of the same moment as the signed woodwork, and therefore commissioned by the great drawings collector Zaccaria Sagredo, whose monogram is above the archway in the room and who died in 1729. Aikema (1997) convincingly argued that the bedroom may be somewhat later than the other rooms of the suite, and if work on the stucco ceiling decorations of the various rooms continued through the 1720s, then the painting of Dawn could be assigned to the 1730s. Zugni Tauro (1971) had dated the canvas to circa 1755–60.Katharine Baetjer 2016",

Many parts of the palace were dismantled and sold in the early twentieth century, when this room entered The Met’s collection. Stuccoists Abbondio Stazio (1633–1745) and Carpoforo Mazzetti Tencalla (1685–1743) probably completed the three-dimensional frame in the 1720s, though Diziani may not have supplied his painting until the 1750s. His allegorical depiction of Dawn was perfectly suited to the room’s function, and her attendant putti echoed the stucco figures that seem to hold the canvas aloft.",

        "Catalogue Entry": "Isabey was born in Nancy, where he studied with the painter Jean-Baptiste Charles Claudot (1733–1805), who also taught Jean-Baptiste Jacques Augustin (1759–1832; see17.190.1120a, b) and Jean Antoine Laurent (1763–1832). He went to Paris in 1786 and received some patronage from Marie Antoinette; however, he rose to a preeminent role among the early-nineteenth-century French miniaturists through his pupil Hortense de Beauharnais (1783–1837). She introduced him to Napoléon I, who was her stepfather and brother-in-law. Isabey became his court painter and had to maintain a number of studio assistants to help him provide the great number of miniatures of the emperor which he was called on to produce. His earlier works were done on ivory, but in the second decade of the nineteenth century he adopted the new technique of painting on paper stretched over sheets of metal. This enabled him to work on a larger scale and contributed to the fluent brushwork and luminosity of his later portrait miniatures.The attribution to Isabey of this portrait of an unknown woman was rejected by Richard Allen in 1977. The signature appears to be authentic, however, and the date, 1790, is consistent with the sitter's costume. Although a relatively early work, lacking his later flamboyance, this is a representative example of Isabey's first manner. A similar miniature, signed and dated 1787, is in the Musée du Louvre (Pierrette Jean-Richard,Miniatures sur ivoire, Paris, 1994, no. 347, ill.).[2016; adapted from Reynolds and Baetjer 1996]",

        "Catalogue Entry": "The Artist:Piero di Cosimo is one of the great eccentrics of Italian painting. He was a decade younger than Leonardo da Vinci and thirteen years older than Michelangelo. He was keenly aware of Leonardo’s ideas about nature, but his training provided an altogether more conservative background. As a youth he worked on the frescoes decorating the walls of the Sistine Chapel under the direction of his teacher Cosimo Rosselli. He thus worked alongside Botticelli, Perugino, and Signorelli. He was, in short, a painter with a foot in two worlds, and although Vasari places Piero’s biography firmly among the \"moderns\"—between Correggio and Bramante—he went out of his way to emphasize the artist’s eccentricities. As a youth, Vasari claimed the artist \"was likewise so great a lover of solitude, that he knew no pleasure save that of going off by himself with his thoughts, letting his fancy roam and building his castles in the air.\" He went on to describe how, \"He could not bear the crying of children, the coughing of men, the sound of bells, and the chanting of friars; and when the rain was pouring in torrents from the sky, it pleased him to see it streaming straight down from the roofs and splashing on the ground. He had the greatest terror of lightning; and, when he heard very loud thunder, he wrapped himself in his mantle, and, having closed the windows and the door of the room, he crouched in a corner until the storm should pass. He was very varied and original in his discourse, and sometimes said such beautiful things, that he made his hearers burst with laughter. But when he was old, and near the age of eighty, he had become so strange and eccentric that nothing could be done with him.\" It is as eccentric geniuses that Piero and his pupil Jacopo Pontormo appear in Rudolf Wittkower’s classic study,Born under Saturn(1963). The Met’s two paintings have often been viewed as reflecting this peculiar side of Piero’s persona.Description:Long recognized as among the most singular paintings of the Renaissance, these two panels share a common history and are of a type and size that, in the fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries, characterize paintings that were either set into the paneling of a room or adorned the backrest of a pair of cassapanca (spalliere). In one panel, goat-hoofed satyrs and men wearing animal pelts take advantage of the panic created by a forest fire to hunt game. Fleeing animals become the prey both of other animals and of hunters: in the center foreground a lion attacks a bear and, in turn, is attacked by another bear who is wrestled by a man wearing a lion’s pelt. The latter is assisted by two accomplices, one of whom pulls the lion’s tail while the other—a satyr—prepares to club the animals (or, less likely in my view, to club one of the humans). Violence is pervasive and its deadly consequences are equally distributed among humans and beasts: a dead animal, lying on its back at the left, is counterbalanced by the bloody corpse of a man who met a violent death. Both are viewed in acute foreshortening, the animal feet-first and the man head-first, recalling the celebrated foreshortened figures by Paolo Uccello in his fresco of the Flood and his scenes of the Battle of San Romano. In the second panel—unfortunately not well preserved—what would appear to be the same forest fire with hunters is seen in the distance, on the far side of a lake, while in the foreground men and women arrive in boats made of reeds and laden with the fruits of the hunt. In contrast to what is found in its companion panel, the mood is one of conviviality and mutual affection between male and female and also between humans and satyrs.Ownership and questions surrounding the commission:The earliest certain reference to the two panels is in an inventory of 1639, when they were in the collection of Marcello Sacchetti (1586–1629) in Rome: “Two companion pictures about three palmi high and seven long, with diverse satyrs and hunting with black frames with gold detailing” (\"Due quadri compagni alti tre palmi incirca lunghi palmi sette in circa con diversi satiri, e caccie, con le cornice nere rabescate d’oro\"). The two panels can be traced through inventories of the Sacchetti collection until 1744, when they were ascribed to Mantegna (the inventory information was generously furnished by Sergio Guarino; see Museum files). Marcello was the son of Giovanni Battista Sacchetti (1540–1620), who established a branch of the family in Rome, founding a bank there in 1573 and marrying Francesca Altoviti. However, whether the pictures formed part of the Sacchetti or Altoviti inheritance or were purchased in Rome on the market has yet to be established. Nonetheless, the fact that they were viewed as a pair is highly significant and must be added to other reasons advanced in the recent literature (Lloyd 1984, Fermor 1993, Geronimus 2006) for a reconsideration of the influential hypothesis put forward by Erwin Panofsky in 1937 that the two pictures formed part of an extensive cycle described by Vasari in the 1550 edition of his biography of Piero in theLives: “For the house of Francesco Pugliese [Piero] likewise made diverse stories with small figures to go round a room. Nor is it possible to describe the fantastic things that it pleased him to paint, whether buildings or animals, clothes, diverse implements and other fantasies that occurred to him, since they are fables, such as the painting of Mars and Venus with cupids, and Vulcan done with great art and incredible patience” (\"Fece parimente in casa di Francesco del Pugliese intorno a una camera storie di figure piccole, nè si può esprimere la diversità de le cose fantastiche che egli in tutte quelle si dilettò dipignere e di casamenti e d’animali e di abiti e strumenti diverse, et altre fantasie che gli sovennono per essere storie di favole, come un quadro di Marte e Venere con i suoi amori e Vulcano fatto con una grande arte e con pazienza incredibile\"; ed. Einaudi, 1986, pp. 573–74). Panofsky was not the first scholar to associate The Met’s pictures with the \"storie di figure piccole\" owned by the wool merchant Francesco del Pugliese (1458–1519), who, like his uncle Piero del Pugliese, was a significant patron of the artist. But he argued on the basis of a presumed literary program that the cycle included what seems a very anomalous group of pictures, including a painting of a forest fire in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford (on panel), that measures 71.2 x 202 cm and two works (on canvas) showing the finding of Vulcan (Wadsworth Atheneum, Hartford) and Vulcan and Aeolus as teachers of mankind (National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa), which measure 155 x 174.5 and 155.5 x 166.5 cm respectively. He imagined the five pictures as forming a unified cycle tracing the early history of man, the two large canvases displayed in one room of the Pugliese palace on the via de’ Serragli in Florence and the three panels in another. Most scholars today would eliminate from consideration the two canvases—so divergent in size, support, character, and subject matter—while a further panel, showing the construction of a large palace (John and Mable Ringling Museum, Sarasota, Florida, 77.5 x 196.9 cm), has also sometimes been associated with the Met and Ashmolean paintings (see Fahy 1965 and Zeri and Gardner 1971) but has also been eliminated from consideration (Forlani Tempesti and Capretti 1996, pp. 130–33). Farinella (2015) has made the most recent case for including both the Ashmolean and Sarasota panels and for adding as well yet another picture by Piero showing a battle between lapiths and centaurs (National Gallery, London) that is usually understood as an independent work. Farinella has established that by 1588 the Sarasota panel belonged to the Botti family, who inhabited what had been a portion of the old Pugliese palace. Had they acquired the picture with the palace and was it, therefore, the work Vasari admired for its \"cassamenti\"? Perhaps. But if so, it is curious that he did not give a more specific description of the work and in the 1568 edition of theVitedid not note the transfer of ownership, since he was on close terms (\"amicissimo\") with Matteo di Simone Botti.Precisely because so much concerning this cycle remains conjectural, beginning with the ambiguity of Vasari's comments, it is worth pointing out some possible objections. Not least among them is the fact that both the Ashmolean and the Sarasota panels employ rigorously centralized compositions and could easily be imagined as independent paintings, one treating the early history of man, the other the construction of a Renaissance palace—in the tradition of an ideal city view. As for The Met's two panels, it remains a puzzle why, if they formed part of the Pugliese cycle, Vasari did not describe them in the same terms he used for the remarkably similar decorations Francesco Francia painted in 1500–1506 on the caparisons for a horse (\"un par di barde da Cavallo\") for the Duke of Urbino: \"a vast forest of trees that had caught fire, from which there were issuing great numbers of all sorts of animals, both of the air and of the earth, and certain figures, a terrible, awful, and truly beautiful thing” (“fece una selva grandissima d’alberi che vi era appicciato il fuoco, e fuor di quella usciva quantità grande di tutti gli animali aerei e terrestri, et alcune figure; cosa terribile, spaventosa e veramente bella\"; 1550; ed. Einaudi, 1986, p. 521).A wool merchant, Francesco del Pugliese was a prominent citizen and an avid patron of the arts. His uncle had commissioned altarpieces from Filippino Lippi (the church of the Badia, Florence) and Piero di Cosimo (Saint Louis Museum of Art) and seems to have been interested in stoic literature. Francesco’s commissions seem to have been primarily private: devotional works from Filippino Lippi and, notably, Botticelli’sLast Communion of Saint Jerome(14.40.642). By contrast, to judge from Vasari’s description, the  pictures painted by Piero for Pugliese were mythological in theme and centered on Mars, Venus, and Vulcan—the kind of theme appropriate to a bedroom. It might be thought that The Met's panels would be better suited to a scholar’s study.The literary sources and interpretation:It should be remembered that Panofsky's reconstruction was argued purely on the basis of a presumed literary program rather than on a similarity of style and composition. Where he was undoubtedly correct was in identifying the theme of the two paintings in The Met as having to do with the early history of man as described by classical sources: Vitruvius’sDe Architectura libri decem(Book 2, chapter 1); Diodorus Siculus’sBibliotheca historica; and, most significantly, the fifth book of theDe rerum naturaby the first-century B.C. Epicurean poet and philosopher Lucretius. Vitruvius traces the origins of civilization to the discovery of fire: “The men of old were born like the wild beasts, in woods, caves, and groves, and lived on savage fare.  As time went on, the thickly crowded trees in a certain place, tossed by storms and winds, and rubbing their branches against one another, caught fire, and so the inhabitants of the place were put to flight, being terrified by the furious flame.  After it subsided, they drew near, and observing that they were very comfortable standing before the warm fire, they put on logs and, while thus keeping it alive brought up other people to it, showing them by signs how much comfort they got from it.”  (trans. Morris Hickymorgan, NY, 1914, Book 2, chap. 1, pp. 38-39) This passage was repeated verbatim by Boccaccio in theGeneologia deorum(Book XII) and was thus well known. By contrast, Lucretius’s work was only discovered by Poggi Bracciolini in 1417. The manuscript was widely copied and read in Florence; the first printed edition dates from 1471–73, and this was followed by editions in Venice (Aldus Manutius, 1500) and Florence (Giunta, 1521; for the various editions, see Ada Palmer (Reading Lucretius in the Renaissance, Cambridge, Mass., 2014, pp. 243–47). Lucretius’s was a radical, Epicurean view of life with an evolutionary account of the origins of the world from random atoms that earned the ridicule of Savonarola in his Lenten sermons of 1496 (Brown 2010, p. 49). In Book V (lns. 837–1160) the Roman poet put forward a reconstruction of the early history of man, the origins of language, and the advent of civilization, describing how primitive humans \"dwelt in the woods and forests and mountain caves, and hid their rough bodies in the underwoods . . . And by the aid of their wonderful powers of hand and foot they would hunt the woodland tribes of beasts with volleys of stones and ponderous clubs, overpowering many, shunning but a few in their lairs . . . .\" This first period was succeeded by a more advanced stage, \"when they had got them huts and skins and fire, and woman mated with man was appropriated to one, and the laws of wedlock became known, and they saw offspring born of them, then first the human race began to grow soft. For the fire saw to it that their shivering bodies were less able to endure cold under the canopy of heaven . . . .\"Lucretius’s poem is unquestionably important for understanding Piero's paintings but no less crucial to their very individual character is an awareness of the various humanist responses to Lucretius and the kinds of discussions and controversies his work inspired. Alison Brown has written perceptively about this in an essay of 2001 and a book of 2010, singling out the importance of the humanist circle around Bartolomeo Scala (1430–1497), the Chancellor of Florence from 1465 to 1497. He was a keen student of Lucretius’s literary masterpiece, as was Michele Marullo Tarcaniota (1453–1500) and Scala's successor as chancellor, Marcello Adriani (1464–1521). Although Lucretius was discussed among humanists in the 1480s, the crucial years of interest and debate appear to be those immediately following the death of Lorenzo il Magnifico in 1494, which saw the expulsion of the Medici, the rise of Savonarola, and the establishment of the Florentine Republic under Piero Soderini. As is well known, Francesco Pugliese became a strong supporter of Savonarola, but whether, previously, he had been a student of Lucretius has yet to be demonstrated (though, of course, it is perfectly possible).In his inaugural lecture for the studium of Florence for the academic year of 1495–96 Adriani specifically referred to Lucretius to draw an analogy with the deteriorating political situation in Florence, which he compared to that era “before the founding of cities, in that first newness of the world when men, as Lucretius said, ‘could not recognize the common good. They knew no binding customs, used no laws. Every man, wise in staying strong, surviving, kept for himself the spoils that fortune offered’.” Quite apart from the political situation, Brown has also pointed to the interest in primitive society that was inspired by the Portuguese exploration of the west coast of Africa, noting that a letter regarding these discoveries was read out on the main square in Florence in 1486. The later voyages of Amerigo Vespucci (1499–1502) further fueled this interest. It would thus seem that this moment in the political and cultural life of the city provided the catalyst and possibly even the occasion for Piero’s paintings.So far from following Lucretius’s text scrupulously by describing two successive states of civilization, The Met’s two panels constitute Piero’s personal visualization of a single early moment in the history of humankind, portraying different aspects of that moment by viewing the reactions of primitive society to a forest fire from two different vantage points. In this sense, too, the pictures seem to have been conceived as pendant panels. Importantly, in neither picture does he paint the “discovery” or “taming” of fire—the crucial feature that both Vitruvius and Lucretius felt was responsible for bringing mankind together. Moreover, whereas Lucretius specifically denied the existence of satyrs and centaurs and noted that \"the wicked art of navigation then lay hidden and obscure\" and that primitive man \"could not look to the common good\" but lived \"for himself at his own will\", Piero goes his own way. Concerning such divergences from the text Brown has written, “It is not my argument that all these artists necessarily read Lucretius but rather that the cultural climate after 1494 encouraged the diffusion of his Epicurean naturalism.” In other words, Lucretius should not be seen as the literary source for a tightly conceived iconographic program, but rather as the catalyst for imaginatively conceived visualizations of primitive life growing out of discussions among Florentine humanists. Seen in this light, The Met’s paintings represent Piero’s personal and highly idiosyncratic contribution. His panels—regardless of whether they formed part of a larger cycle or were, after all, conceived as an independent pair—must have been intended to elicit both delight and inspire erudite discussion. Although they have been dated as early as ca. 1488 and as late as ca. 1513—the latter on the basis of a perceived response by Piero to the work of Leonardo da Vinci—it seems more reasonable to place them in this crucial moment of Florentine history, ca. 1494–1500.Keith Christiansen 2015",

        "Intro Description": "The oblong shape and erudite subject matter of these paintings suggest they originally functioned as panels in a room intended for study and contemplation. The artist has imagined the early history of humanity unfolding in a landscape setting. In one scene, humans and mythological creatures take advantage of a forest fire to hunt animals. In the second, they transport their spoils ashore. Piero drew his inspiration from the Roman poet and philosopher Lucretius (ca. 99–55 BCE), whose work had been rediscovered in the 1400s. Lucretius believed that the workings of the world could be accounted for by natural rather than divine causes, and he put forward a vision of human history that differed strikingly from biblical accounts.",

        "Catalogue Entry": "The Artist:Girolamo dai Libri (ca. 1474–1555) belonged to a four-generation family of miniaturists (Stefano, Francesco, Girolamo, and Francesco di Girolamo). The first member known by the name \"dai Libri\" (of the books) was Girolamo’s grandfather Stefano (active by 1433–died by 1482) as documented by his tax assessment from 1433. In the following years he was also documented as both \"scriptor\" (writer) and \"aminiator\" (miniaturist) (Castiglioni 1985). Unfortunately we do not know any works by him, but Joachim Eberhardt (\"Nuovi Studi su Domenico Morone, Girolamo dai Libri e Liberale,\" inMiniatura veronese del Rinascimento, ed. Gino Castiglioni and Sergio Marinelli, exh. cat., Verona, 1986, pp. 137–38) tentatively attributed to Stefano a body of illuminations catalogued under the sobriquet Maestro degli Offici di Montecassino. The only documented illumination by a member of this family of miniaturists is a late work by Girolamo’s father, Francesco dai Libri, dating from 1503 (he died between 1503 and 1514), which depictsGod the Father Blessing a Worshipper. This discovery allowed scholars to identify other illuminations by Francesco, an artist strongly influenced by Andrea Mantegna (Miniatura veronese del Rinascimento, ed. Gino Castiglioni and Sergio Marinelli, Verona, 1986; Castiglioni et al. 2008). So far as we know, his son Girolamo was the only member of the family who also painted large-scale works. Girolamo signed monumental altarpieces for churches in Verona (Eberhardt 1974, pp. 150–51) and these are also the point of reference for his activity as miniaturist.The Picture:The Madonna and Child are seated on a throne beneath a large laurel tree, flanked by, on one side, Saints Catherine of Alexandria and Leonard—the patron of the church—and, on the other, Augustine and Apollonia. Three music-making angels are grouped below the Madonna and Child and in the distance is an elaborate landscape with, on the left, a rocky mountain crowned by a fortress. A peacock is perched in a dead tree, these two features being a common symbol of immortality and of Christ’s victory over death. We are indebted to Vasari and his local source, Fra Marco de’ Medici, for the first detailed description of The Met’s altarpiece when it was still on the high altar of the Olivetan church of San Leonardo in Monte, in the hills around the city of Verona.\"For S. Leonardo nel Monte, also, near Verona, he painted at the commission of the Cartieri family the altarpiece of the high altar, which is a large work with many figures, and much esteemed by everyone, above all for its very beautiful landscape. Now a thing that has happened very often in our own day has caused this work to be held to be a marvel. There is a tree painted by Girolamo in the picture, and against it seems to rest the great chair on which the Madonna is seated. This tree, which has the appearance of a laurel, projects considerably with its branches over the chair, and between the branches, which are not very thick, may be seen a sky so clear and beautiful, that the tree seems to be truly a living one, graceful and most natural. Very often, therefore, birds that have entered the church by various openings have been seen to fly to this tree in order to perch upon it, and particularly swallows, which had their nests among the beams of the roof, and likewise their little ones. Many persons well worthy of credence declare that they have seen this, among them Don Giuseppe mangiuoli of Verona, a person of saintly life, who has twice been General of his Order and would not for anything in the world assert a thing that was not absolutely true, and also don Girolamo Volpini, likewise a Veronese, and many others.\" (translation by Gaston du C. de Vere, 1912, ed. 1996, p. 46)Despite Vasari’s account, we do not know precisely who the patron of this work was, because while Vasari, Dal Pozzo (1718), and Dalla Rosa (1803–4) name the Carteri (or Cartieri) family as proprietors of the chapel, Lanceni (1720) and Biancolini (1750) allude to the Cartolari family: both were from Verona. The cloister of St. Leonardo was particularly famous in the Renaissance because it was decorated by an anonymous cycle of frescoes and inscriptions invented by Matteo Bosso in 1493–94 (G. Soranzo, \"Il monastero veronese di San Leonardo e Matteo Bosso,\"Vita veronese12 [1959], pp. 264–67). They are unfortunately lost now, but they could be identified with those described by Giovan Battista da Persico (Descrizione di Verona e della sua provincia, Verona, 1821, vol. 2, p. 150): \"Qui da una loggia, dal moderno padrone signor Biadego ornata di buone epigrafi in onor del luogo, presentasi al guardo la bella Verona . . .\" (Beautiful Verona can be seen from a loggia of the present owner, signor Biadego, furnished with good inscriptions recalling the memory of the site). Although the monastery was suppressed in 1769, we know much about the history of the altarpiece following its removal from the church (Canossa 1911). Local sources identify the first owner as Giovanni Battista Beadego, who bought the church and convent with their furniture (Dalla Rosa 1803–4). Subsequently, the altarpiece was acquired by a member of the Gianfilippi family (Dalla Rosa 1803–4, p. 224), and through the Bolognese antique dealer Giovanni Battista Armano it was sold in April 1801 to Alexander Douglas, Marquess of Douglas, later 10th Duke of Hamilton, who installed it on the staircase of Hamilton Palace in Lanark, near Glasgow (Waagen 1854, Gardner 1972, Tormen 2009); the painting probably never belonged to a Genoese family, as Bernasconi (1864) believed.The Met’s painting is unquestionably the most spectacular of Girolamo dai Libri’s altarpieces, all of which were painted for Veronese churches. As with The Met’s work, these altarpieces all are set in open landscapes and testify to Girolamo’s education as miniaturist, to which he remained faithful his whole life. In a document from 1530, in which he was asked to judge the work of a certain Girolamo Arloti (or de’ Arlati), his assessment was introduced by the following words: \"Un bon et valente depentor bisogna chel sapia ben imitar la natura, et fenzer quello che fa la natura, et essere universale in depenzer paesi, figure de ogni sorta, animali et paesi, et casamenti, et generaliter tute le cose che produse la natura\" (A good and valiant painter must know how to imitate nature well, and imitate what nature does, and to be universal in painting landscapes, figures of all sorts, animals, landscapes and buildings and in general all the things that nature produces; Castiglioni et al. 2008, p. 129).A similar flourishing laurel tree appears in theMadonna dell’ombrello(1530), in which an angel supports an umbrella (formerly in Santa Maria della Vittoria Nuova, now in the Museo di Castelvecchio, Verona). TheMadonna and Child with Saint Anne(1518), formerly in the church of Santa Maria della Scala (now in the National Gallery, London), and theMadonna and Child with Saints Lorenzo Giustiniani and Zeno(1526) in San Giorgio in Braida, Verona, contain a lemon tree in the background and three playing and singing angels at bottom. Analogies for the organization of the setting can be found in theMadonna and Child with Saints Anne, Joseph, and Joachimin S. Paolo in Campo Marzio, Verona, and theMadonna della quercia(Madonna of the Oak), formerly in S. Andrea (now in the Museo di Castelvecchio). Girolamo probably employed the same cartoon for the angels in theMadonna and Child with Saints Bartholomew and Zeno, formerly in Santa Maria in Organo (now in the Bodemuseum, Berlin).As is the case with the early Renaissance painters of Verona, Girolamo was strongly impressed by Andrea Mantegna’sSan Zeno Altarpiece, painted between 1457 and 1459. After more than half a century, Girolamo still looked to that work as a model, copying the group of the Madonna and Child in thePala Centregoin Sant’Anastasia. Andrea Mantegna’s work, together with that of the most important Venetian painters from the end of the fifteenth and the beginning of the sixteenth century, played an important role in the education of two generations of Veronese artists. Domenico Morone, Francesco dai Libri, and, later, Girolamo’s colleagues Francesco Bonsignori, Francesco Morone, and Michele da Verona (see27.41) created their particular \"Veronese\" interpretation of the early Renaissance in the North of Italy from the legacy of Mantegna, Giovanni Bellini, Vittore Carpaccio, and Cima da Conegliano.Mattia Vinco 2017",

While the Madonna and Child reflect the work of Andrea Mantegna, the distant hill crowned with a fortress and the dead tree are taken over directly from Dürer's well-known engraving of Saint Eustace. The juxtaposition of the dead tree with the flourishing laurel refers to Death and Resurrection, while the peacock is a traditional symbol of immortality.A versatile artist, Girolamo dai Libri was equally famous as an illuminator of books, whence his name dai Libri (\"of the books\"). Of modern manufacture, the frame is based on Renaissance prototypes.",

        "Catalogue Entry": "Romanino painted this double-sided standard, whose original function was to be carried in processions, around 1540 for an unidentified lay confraternity, probably connected with a church in or near the north Italian city of Brescia. The obverse of the banner depicts the flagellation of Christ, whose pale, exposed body stands out from the crowd of his tormentors who surround him. They brandish bunches of twigs, or kneel to tie together more of them, faces concentrated on their tasks. On the reverse the Madonna of Mercy, with Saints Francis and Anthony of Padua behind her, encircles and protects a group of kneeling, robed men holding scourges. At least some of these seem to be portraits of the members of the flagellant confraternity that commissioned the banner, which they would have carried in religious processions. To this end Romanino painted on a thin and very fine support, probably in distemper, a medium of pigments mixed with glue size on a barely primed canvas (the medium has not been scientifically analyzed). Artists were able to work fluidly and quickly in this medium, and the surfaces of paintings in distemper were matte and distinctive in appearance. The medium was often used in northern Italy for works of art on canvas that needed to travel (the canvas could be rolled) or were to be seen from a distance, including organ shutters and banners. Damage at the bottom center of the banner (seen clearly on the reverse) suggests that it was originally attached to a pole at its base, by which it would have been carried. Later it was probably hung permanently in a church, with only one side on view and with the Madonna of Mercy covered by a lining (for the technique and conservation of the painting see Bayer 2003).Around 1540, Romanino undertook to paint a number of significant works in this medium, all related stylistically. These include organ shutters for the church of San Giorgio in Braida, Verona, and two large canvases of the Adoration of the Magi, possibly also originally shutters, now in SS. Nazaro e Celso in Brescia (for these see Nova 1994, pp. 307–8, no. 78, and pp. 309–10, no. 81; andRomanino: un pittore in rivolta nel Rinascimento italiano.Exh. cat., Castello del Buonconsiglio, Trent. Cinisello Balsamo, Milan, 2006, nos. 31a and b, and 33a and b). In each the artist has devised a composition of tightly packed figures to create a sense of commotion and urgency, and has experimented with strong effects of light and shadow across faces and bodies, adding to a sense of drama. The rough plebeian faces and contemporary clothing may have been inspired by German prints by artists such as Hans Baldung Grien, and the vehement expressivity may have its impetus in northern works known to Romanino as well. By contrast, the composition and treatment of the reverse has more in common with related works by Romanino’s contemporary, Moretto da Brescia.It is unfortunate that the identity of this Franciscan confraternity has not yet been discovered. The artist is known to have painted a processional banner in 1537 for the members of the confraternity of S. Maria delle Grazie e di San Girolamo, who met in the church of S. Maria delle Grazie, but this was a community of Hieronymites rather than Franciscans (seeRomanino: un pittore in rivolta nel Rinascimento italiano, p. 416). There is no indication that the Franciscan confraternity in Brescia, known as the Congregazione francescana dei Capriolanti, which by 1540 was attached to the newly-built church of San Giuseppe, had a work by the artist. It is likely that by the 1580s the painting was hung somewhere conspicuous, as it seems clear that Caravaggio, who grew up in a neighboring town and studied in nearby Milan, saw it and referred to it when painting hisFlagellation of Christfor the Dominicans in Naples in 1607 (Museo Nazionale di Capodimonte, Naples).Andrea Bayer 2013",

        "Frame": "The frame may be Venetian and dates to about 1500–1520 (see figs. 1–4 above). This solemn carved giltwood and paintedcassettaframe is made of pine and has applied walnut moldings on its face. An acanthus leaf with fillet and cavetto-carved sight edge lies within the narrow-painted frieze. A course of fluting rises to acanthus leaf carving before the fillet at the top edge. The painted vertical on the outside falls to acanthus carving at the back edge. Stiffly carved and later gessoed with overgilding and paint obscuring the walnut, this modified frame may have been assembled and enlarged using architectural cornice moldings from a Venetian sacristy ceiling.Timothy Newbery with Cynthia Moyer 2020; further information on this frame can be found in the Department of European Paintings files",
        "Intro Description": "Romanino painted this expressive depiction of the flagellation of Christ as a processional banner for a confraternity, or lay religious group, in Brescia, a city not far from Milan. Contemporary German prints, which circulated widely in northern Italy, inspired its dramatically compressed composition and the vehemence of the brutish executioners. Caravaggio, the groundbreaking artist of the next generation, spent his formative years in the region and almost certainly knew and admired this painting. On its reverse, now unfortunately somewhat damaged, Romanino painted the Madonna of Mercy surrounded by kneeling members of the confraternity.

        "Catalogue Entry": "The daughter of an army sergeant, Hendrickje Stoffels advanced in Rembrandt's household from servant (by 1649) to mistress, presumed model, and common-law wife, as well as stepmother to the artist's son Titus (1641–1668) and mother of his daughter Cornelia (1654–1685). Over the past hundred years, this portrait has been given many subjective, even novelistic interpretations, which are mostly based on the assumption that the features of Hendrickje are here faithfully transcribed. No indisputable image of her has been identified, although the present work is considered a plausible example of the Hendrickje type. Its attribution to Rembrandt has never been reasonably doubted. However, the awkwardly placed signature and date of 1660 must have been added during a later period. The work probably dates from the mid-1650s.Hendrickje's relationship to Rembrandt and the picture's supposed date of 1660 encouraged the persistent misconception that it was probably intended by Rembrandt as a pendant to hisSelf-Portraitof 1660 (The Met14.40.618). Although the paintings are now about the same size, the figures differ in scale, presentation, and execution, and the works were (so far as is known) never in the same building before 1925. Moreover, the idea that Rembrandt would have presented himself and his mistress in companion portraits raises questions of propriety that modern scholars have for the most part ignored. The normal inhibitions to such a pictorial statement would have been considerably enhanced by Hendrickje's pregnancy in 1654, for which she was called before the council of the Reformed Church in Amsterdam and banned from taking communion.Hendrickje is thought to have modeled for three comparable paintings by Rembrandt: one perhaps of about 1653–54 (Musée du Louvre, Paris), one probably of the mid-1650s (National Gallery, London), and theWoman at an Open Doorof about 1656 (Gemäldegalerie, Berlin). The order in which the four pictures were painted, their dating in general, and the degree to which each of them reflects the appearance of Hendrickje at a particular time are all matters of conjecture. However, the faces in the New York and Berlin paintings (the two that most closely resemble each other) seem to reveal more age than the apparently prettified features in the London and Paris pictures.It is quite likely that the four works were intended to be understood as images of courtesans, comparable with those painted by Venetian artists, especially Palma Vecchio. It is also likely that The Met's work was begun around 1654–55, when pictures of courtesans appear to have flourished in Amsterdam. The final stage of painting could have been carried out after a brief interval, or within one or two years.[2013; adapted from Liedtke 2007]",

        "Intro Description": "Hendrickje Stoffels, the daughter of a soldier, worked as Rembrandt’s housekeeper, eventually becoming his common-law wife and mother of their daughter, Cornelia. While no formal portraits of Stoffels survive, she is believed to have modeled for a number of Rembrandt’s paintings, including this work, perhaps intended as a generic image of a courtesan. The figure’s intimate gesture of holding her robe closed with one hand echoes the close observations Rembrandt made of the women in his household in many surviving drawings.",

        "Catalogue Entry": "When the painting came to the Museum in 1956, the figure was attributed to William Hogarth, and the horse, owing in part to the presence of the monogram, to John Sartorius (1700–ca. 1780). In 1977, Judy Egerton convincingly identified it as a good example of the work of James Seymour, similar to two others then in Paul Mellon’s private collection. The following year, Malcolm Cormack pointed out that the form of the monogram is the same as that on Seymour'sDuke of Devonshire's Flying Childers(Yale Center for British Art, New Haven). John Harris (1981) identified the main building in the background as St. George’s Hospital, London, as it appeared after the remodeling by Isaac Ware in 1733. The view, therefore, was taken from a fairly distant point in Hyde Park Gardens and, as Harris also pointed out, includes Chelsea Hospital to the right. The handling is typically sharp, neat, and legible, while the portrayals of the horse and dog are superior to the rather wooden, expressionless portrait of the rider, whose head is large for his stiffly erect body. Several old tears in the green areas of the background do not impinge on either the figure or the animals.[2010; adapted from Baetjer 2009]",

        "Intro Description": "Once well known as a Rembrandt, this large canvas has also been attributed to the master's pupil, Nicolaes Maes (1643–1693), and to Abraham van Dijck (ca. 1635?–1680?). The two artists were closely associated in Dordrecht, the southern Dutch city from which several Rembrandt followers came. Whatever its authorship, the painting must date from about 1655–60. The sewing materials and the act of clipping nails probably suggest domestic virtues of a kind often associated with widowhood. The monumental treatment is unexpected and surely inspired by Rembrandt.",

        "Intro Description": "Diana, the Roman goddess of the hunt, is famously chaste and modest, but Diaz de la Peña depicts her half-nude, with a retinue of beautiful women and a young arrow-bearer who resembles Cupid, the god of love. Bright illumination and draperies emphasize the physicality of the goddess, while her companions are cast in shadow. The soft brushwork and warm colors reflect the artist’s admiration for earlier Italian and French painting. Diaz specialized in this type of idealized, romantic imagery, but he also earned a considerable reputation as a painter of naturalistic landscapes.",

        "Catalogue Entry": "The Artist:Born in Saint-Gilles-du-Gard in the south of France, Subleyras studied with his father, Mathieu, and in 1717 entered the Toulouse workshop of Antoine Rivalz, for whom he acted as a principal assistant in 1722. He received his first independent commission in 1725, for canvases for the ceiling of the Chapelle des Pénitents Blancs in Toulouse (now in the Musée des Augustins), and at about the same time began working as a portraitist. He moved to Paris in 1726 and won the Prix de Rome the following year withMoses and the Brazen Serpent(Musée des Beaux-Arts, Nîmes). His stay at the Académie de France was extended from the autumn of 1728 until 1735, despite some opposition from the director, Nicolas Vleughels, and owing to the support and patronage of the French ambassador to Rome, the duc de Saint-Agnan, for whom he illustrated four scenes from the fables of Jean de La Fontaine (Musée du Louvre, Paris) and painted, in 1737,The Duc de Saint-Aignan Awards the Cordon Bleu of the Saint-Esprit to Prince Girolamo Vaini(Musée National de la Légion d’Honneur, Paris). Subleyras married the Roman miniaturist Maria Felice Tibaldi in 1739 and in 1740 was elected to membership in the prestigious Accademia di San Luca. Owing in part to ill health, and because he found patrons locally, he declined to return to France and refused invitations to take up positions at court in either Dresden or Madrid. He had increasing success with his portraits, the most important of which represent Frederick Christian of Saxony, son of the elector Augustus II, painted in 1739 (Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Gemäldegalerie, Dresden), and Pope Benedict XIV, painted in 1740–41 and later given by the sitter to the Sorbonne (it is now in the Musée Condé, Chantilly). Subleyras received major commissions from religious orders, notably from the Lateran Canons, in 1737, for the enormous and well receivedBanquet in the House of Simon the Pharisee(Musée du Louvre, Paris) as well as for altarpieces for the churches of Rome, and for the cathedrals of Toulouse and Grasse, in 1741. A brilliant colorist and an accomplished draftsman and printmaker, Subleyras died of tuberculosis at the age of forty-nine.The Painting:Having completed the portrait of Pope Benedict XIV in 1741, Subleyras was granted in 1743 the major papal commission for St. Peters Basilica of \"Saint Basile Celebrating Mass in front of Emperor Valens.\" The canvas, finished in 1747, was briefly displayed in St. Peter’s in Rome in 1748.The work was translated into mosaic, and designated for display not far away from the mosaic after Poussin ofThe Martyrdom of Saint Erasmus. In 1752 the monumental painting was moved to an altar in Santa Maria degli Angeli, where it can still be seen today.Three works showing the full composition are usually accepted as autograph: amodelloin the Musée du Louvre, Paris; another in the State Hermitage, St. Petersburg; and our picture. There are substantial differences between the Louvremodelloand ours, which is closer to the altarpiece, and second in sequence, while the Hermitage painting follows ours and may have been painted by the workshop. Our picture is probably the one kept by the artist and reproduced in his paintingThe Atelier(now in the Akademie, Vienna).The Ateliershows the original “Marata” frame, which is still on the present work, although enlarged and transformed in the nineteenth century.The subject is a rare one and concerns Saint Basil the Great (ca. 330–379) and his resistance to the Arian emperor Valens. Basil is shown surrounded by priests, receiving the consecrated wine from a deacon. Valens’ required gifts of bread for communion have been brought by figures at the left, while to the right the emperor swoons, moved by the solemnity of the event, which takes place in a church interior lit by a shaft of light. The scene follows quite closely Gregory of Nazianzus’s funeral oration for Saint Basil (XLIII, para. 52):“Upon his entrance [the emperor] was struck by the thundering roll of the Psalms, by the sea of heads of the congregation, and by the angelic rather than human order which pervaded the sanctuary and its precincts: while Basil presided over his people, standing erect, as the Scripture says of Samuel, with body and eyes and mind undisturbed, as if nothing new had happened, but fixed upon God and the sanctuary, as if, so to say, he had been a statue, while his ministers stood around him in fear and reverence. At this sight, and it was indeed a sight unparalleled, overcome by human weakness, his eyes were affected with dimness and giddiness, his mind with dread. . . . But when he had to offer the gifts at the Table of God, which he must needs do himself, since no one would, as usual, assist him, because it was uncertain whether Basil would admit him, his feelings were revealed. For he was staggering, and had not someone in the sanctuary reached out a hand to steady his tottering steps, he would have sunk to the ground in a lamentable fall.”Keith Christiansen 2010; updated by Katharine Baetjer 2017",
        "Technical Notes": "Support and Paint Layer:Prior to acquisition, the paint film had been transferred from its original support to a new canvas and attached to a keyed stretcher that appears to date from the twentieth century. A rather broad craquelure pattern is visible across the entire surface. The texture of the scrim used in the transfer process has been pressed into the paint film.During transfer the tacking edges at the sides were flattened out and the dimensions of the original support and composition were extended on all four sides by filling and overpainting the gap between the rather ragged edges of the original and the edges of the stretcher. The sides are extended approximately by 2.5 cm, the top by 1.5 cm, and the bottom by 5 cm. The filling and overpaint on all four edges extended rather broadly into the original in order to disguise this expansion. The original pale border of the arched top was also overpainted to enlarge the space depicted in the composition.Despite the transfer there are relatively few losses and the majority are small and generally confined to the perimeter. However, the retouching covering them was crude and excessive. The varnish was very discolored and disrupted the tonal values of the composition, undermining the interplay of warm and silvery hues that is so vital to the creation of space, depth, and drama in the painting.Cleaning:Cleaning confirmed the high quality of themodello. The handling of the paint is virtuoso in its facility and control, and the paint layer in general is in an excellent state of preservation. There is some slight abrasion in the dark passages, usually associated with the presence of pentimenti, where thin layers of dark paint have been brushed over lighter forms. The surface is somewhat gritty, suggesting the presence of lead soaps. The painting has a pale, terracotta-colored first ground followed by a light gray layer. This does not appear to cover the entire surface (for example it is absent from an area in the upper right where the warm pink ground can be seen showing through).It is possible to see some of the main pentimenti in the X-radiograph. The heads of the man and the boy with the basket of loaves in the lower left were enlarged, the gesturing young cleric behind them was added at a comparatively late stage and the ecclesiastical staff on the far left was lowered from a slightly more upright position. Other changes are evident on the actual paint surface, for example Emperor Valens' proper right leg was added on top of his red cloak while the helmeted soldier's head coming in from the right was also a late addition.[Extracted from the Condition and Treatment Report by Michael Gallagher, 2010]",

        "Intro Description": "This is Subleyras’s highly finished proposal, or modello, for his most important commission: a design that would be translated into an enormous mosaic altarpiece for Saint Peter’s Basilica in Rome. Subleyras depicts Saint Basil the Great (ca. 330–379) celebrating Mass in the presence of the Emperor Valens (328–378). The artist’s exceptional ability to depict white in all its tonal range is evident in the robes of the priests who surround Basil as he receives wine for Communion. The young emperor, picked out by his bright red cape, swoons dramatically in response to what he witnesses.",

        "Catalogue Entry": "Netscher's scenes of fashionable figures in luxurious interiors date mostly from the mid-1660s. This one has been placed convincingly about 1665. The subject of courting couples, the figure types, the attention to fine fabrics, the arrangement of the furniture (especially the matching stool and chair), and the dog are all indebted in some degree to the artist's teacher, Gerard ter Borch. As inThe Suitor's Visitof about 1658 by Ter Borch (National Gallery of Art, Washington), Netscher himself appears to have served as a model for one of the suitors here, the seated man.Although not involved in the card game, the tall beauty to the left may be described as the center of attention. She is addressed by a male companion but concentrates on the fluffy lapdog. The love triangle of mistress, suitor, and spaniel recalls that in Frans van Mieris'sTeasing the Petof 1660 (Mauritshuis, The Hague), which influenced a number of contemporary painters. In The Met’s picture, the color of the dog's coat, his earnest eyes, and perhaps the pointing nose and floppy ears underscore a comparison with the young lady's admirer. Some comment on the male visitors also may be detected in the seated woman's smile at the viewer.Netherlandish images comparing courtship with card-playing and other games of chance date back to the first half of the sixteenth century. In older examples, various transgressions are symbolized, but here the cards, like the theorbo and songbook on the chair to the left (the instrument's case, now nearly invisible, is behind the couple to the right), and the wine decanter and glass on a tray on the table, are mere props in a scene that is understood almost entirely in terms of gestures, expressions, and poses. No one surpassed Ter Borch in observing social behavior, but Netscher was sometimes a worthy follower.The subjects of the simulated reliefs on the back wall, which in the Netherlands would likely have been grisaille on canvas, have not been identified previously. The oval composition depicts a victorious rider with a fallen figure beneath a rearing horse. This motif descended from Roman coins and Renaissance designs for equestrian monuments to seventeenth-century sculptures and prints. The other relief is nearly indecipherable, but appears to represent a scene of sea gods, perhaps the Triumph of Venus. It is likely that both images suggest the subjugation of men.[2017; adapted from Liedtke 2007]",

        "Catalogue Entry": "This painting was most likely produced by an assistant in El Greco’s workshop, perhaps about 1610. The apostle and his distinctive X-shaped cross on which he was crucified repeat, with minor changes, the figure and cross filling the left half of El Greco’s signed canvas,Saint Andrew and Saint Francis, in the Museo del Prado, Madrid. That picture (167 x 113 cm) is nearly two feet taller than the Museum’s painting, where the figure of Saint Andrew is considerably smaller in scale. This kind of replica, whether reduced or not, was often made in El Greco’s workshop, evidently on speculation.It is not clear why the Apostle Andrew and St. Francis of Assisi are depicted together in the Prado painting. In the late 1570s Juan Fernández Navarrete (1526–1579) painted a series of large, full-length pictures of paired saints for the monastery of El Escorial, with more predictable combinations, such as Saints Peter and Paul, Saint John the Evangelist with Saint Matthew, and Saint James the Greater with Saint Andrew (who reads a large book). El Greco shows Saint John the Evangelist standing next to Saint John the Baptist in a small canvas of about 1600–1610 (Museo del Prado, Madrid), and slightly smaller workshop pictures repeat each of those saints separately (Museo Cerralbo, Madrid, and Museo de Bellas Artes, Valencia). It has been suggested plausibly (in Ruiz Gómez 2007, p. 110) that the unexpected pairing of Saint Andrew with Saint Francis of Assisi, who lived eleven centuries later, may reflect a special devotion on the part of an unknown patron. In any event, the New York canvas is likely to have been an independent picture and not part of a series (anapostolado).In the Prado picture the saints appear to be in solemn conversation, which is reflected in the rhetorical gesture and turn of the head in the Museum’sSaint Andrew. There is some change in the rendering of the eyes which might be taken to suggest contemplation rather than explication. However, many of El Greco’s half-length pictures of single Apostles combine a demonstrative gesture with a glance downward or to the side.The painting in Madrid is of exceptional quality, with a sense of structure, volume, texture, and natural light in the Apostle’s face, which is framed by wispy hair conjured from remarkably free strokes and jabs of the brush. Throughout the present picture these qualities of execution are repeated in schematic form. The process of simplification is perhaps most obvious in the landscape and sky, where the topography and clouds no longer hint at spatial recession. Based on these shortcomings, Wethey (1962) assumed mistakenly that the canvas had been \"liberally retouched by a modern restorer,\" but since the 1980s scholars such as Jonathan Brown (in a letter to the Museum dated December 12, 1983) and Ruiz Gómez (2007) have described the painting as a typical workshop product, revealing little or no trace of the master’s hand.Walter Liedtke 2014",

It differs from the \"Apostolados\" in the Toledo Cathedral, as well as the other Apostle series [see Ptgs. Dept. Archives], in which St. Andrew is depicted in profile to the left, holding the cross in his right hand (Los Angeles County Museum of Art).Only two other full-length representations of Saint Andrew are recorded: one in the Zuloaga collection in Zumaya, Spain, attributed by Wethey (no. X–232) to a follower of El Greco and dated in the middle of the seventeenth century; and a painting, formerly in the possession of Diego Cánovas in Madrid, attributed to the Spanish school and dated about 1650 (Wethey, no. X–233).",
        "Intro Description": "This painting is a reduced workshop replica of Christ’s apostle Andrew that appears in a larger devotional canvas by El Greco,Saints Andrew and Francis(ca. 1595; Museo del Prado, Madrid). Such replicas demonstrate the popularity and dissemination of El Greco’s style during his own lifetime. Andrew is known as Jesus’s first follower and is said to have preached in Scythia, Asia Minor, and Greece, where he was reportedly martyred on an X-shaped cross like the one seen here.",

        "Object Number:": "89.15.7",
        "Catalogue Entry": "This typical domestic scene dates from about 1643, when Sorgh painted a number of similar subjects. The background was quite thinly painted, and has become more transparent with age and with overcleaning in the past. Technical examination and conservation treatment in 2004 helped to clarify the composition, and permitted study of various changes made by the artist in the course of execution.Two kitchen maids work in the bright light of a tall window. Ivy and an open shutter are seen outside. The standing maid, a fair young woman in green and white, is busy peeling apples, while the kneeling maid, in green and mauve, cleans fish on an overturned tub. The apple peeler's smile may be a response to private thoughts, to the cat inspecting fish fillets in the pot on the right, or to words spoken by the couple at the fireplace. These figures, which Sorgh borrowed fromA Barn Interior with an Amorous Couple(Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen, Rotterdam) and squeezed in between the maids, have become less distinct in the course of time. They were not painted out by the artist and then revealed at a later date.Sorgh used a door, some plates on a shelf, and a few hanging objects (one of which is a grilling rack) to define the sun-washed surface of the rear wall. A spiral staircase in the right background once played an important part in suggesting interior space. The two forms that hang from the rafters would also have enhanced the impression of depth. The dead game bird on a hook close to the window is suspended from the nearest visible beam, and a birdcage with a parrot(?) hangs at a distance that is two beams farther back. These markers in space complement the recessions of the wall on the left, the ceiling boards, and the floor tiles. The tiles are based on a perspective scheme drawn on the prepared panel and then revised.At an earlier stage of the composition, a man in a cap stood in the area just beyond the cat, bent over a large round object that he holds in his hands. Such a figure is familiar from contemporary works by Sorgh, such asA Kitchen Interiorof about 1643 (Museum Stiftung Jakob Briner, Rathaus, Winterthur) where a young man comes into the kitchen with a basket of fish for sale. This may have been the original object of the kneeling woman's glance, and perhaps even the reason for her companion's smile. Kitchen maids had a reputation for entertaining male visitors, and the offer of fish or fowl was often meant as an erotic metaphor. Phallic and seemingly feminine forms, like ladles and pots, and the inclusion of a birdcage might underscore the message. It appears that Sorgh initially intended to describe a more suggestive situation, which he then confined to the awkwardly placed couple in the background. In a much less significant change, the woman by the window was moved slightly, as the dark zone along her left contour suggests. The object on the wall by the window is an iron candleholder, and the dark lines over the mantel are rotisserie spits.The simple title by which this painting has been known for more than a century is, unusually, completely in accord with seventeenth-century descriptions. Works ranging from large, complicated compositions by Pieter Aertsen (1507/8–1575) to pictures by Sorgh and by followers of Gerrit Dou were commonly listed in inventories as \"a kitchen\" (een keuken).[2016; adapted from Liedtke 2007]",

        "Catalogue Entry": "In 1829 Paul Flandrin and his elder brother Hippolyte entered the atelier of Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres and soon earned the master’s affection and respect. In 1832 Hippolyte became Ingres’s first pupil to win the Grand Prix de Rome for history painting, but when Paul failed to secure the prize the following year he joined his brother in Italy anyway, reaching him in early 1834. Ingres himself assumed the directorship of the French Academy in Rome in 1835, thus extending an artistic franchise whose familial overtones would only deepen over time.Once in Rome, where he remained until 1839, Paul’s talents as a landscape painter began to flourish. This study was painted at Frascati, thirteen miles from the city. The villa it depicts was owned by the Torlonia family, bankers who grew rich during the Napoleonic era and whose name would have been well-known to every Frenchman residing in Rome during the early nineteenth century. But its real subject is the deep yet fleeting tones of a sunset’s afterglow. The focus on the rendering of color with a minimum of light—at the precise moment of moonrise—is exceptional even for an artist who typically relied on contre-jour to achieve a curiously refined austerity in his paintings.According to the inscription on a label affixed to an early backing (\"Villa à Frascati / Offert par P Flandrin à Oudiné\"), the artist gave the painting to Eugène-André Oudiné (1810–1887), who had won the Prix de Rome for medal engraving in 1831. The close friendship the gift commemorates was cemented by country outings, perhaps including the one that yielded this study; in June and July 1835 the artists undertook an excursion to Tuscany together with Hippolyte. After returning to Paris they joined with other former Academy pensioners of the era to form the Société du Disque, gathering monthly until 1881 (see Auguste Flandrin,Notice sur Eugène-André Oudiné, sculpteur et graveur en médailles, Paris, 1888, pp. 5, 14–15).Asher Ethan Miller 2013",

        "Intro Description": "In 1800 Robert Shurlock (1772–1847) married John Russell’s daughter, Henrietta Ann Jane Russell (1775–1849), near the artist’s house in Guildford, Surrey. This pastel was likely completed shortly after the marriage, and the companion portrait of Henrietta with the couple’s first child is also in this gallery. Here Mr. Shurlock is a dashing man at the height of his youth, wearing a silk neck scarf and a double-breasted coat with brass buttons. The artist executed several other portraits for his daughter’s family, all dating to 1801.",

        "Notes": "Sometime before 1897 the picture was sawn horizontally into two sections; they were rejoined in 1988. The upper part belongs to the National Gallery of Art, Washington (Samuel H. Kress Collection, 1952.5.8), and the lower part to The Metropolitan Museum.There are two other versions of this subject by Francesco: an illuminated initial in the Museo della cattedrale, Chiusi (Antiphonary B, fol. 3v), and a painting in the High Museum of Art, Atlanta. The source of all three works may be aNativityby Girolamo da Cremona in the Yale University Art Gallery, New Haven (no. 1871.71), which has a similar composition, in reverse. Girolamo was a Lombard painter and miniaturist who worked in Siena from 1470 (see Zeri 1964 and Zeri and Gardner 1980).This picture is listed in the catalogue of the 1904 London exhibition of Sienese paintings as lent by R. H. Benson, and several subsequent references mention Benson as a former owner of the work. In fact, although Benson had the picture on approval from Agnew during 1904–5, he did not buy it (see letter of 12/16/87 in archive file).",
        "Intro Description": "Francesco di Giorgio was an outstanding architect, sculptor, painter, and theorist. Curiously, his fanciful paintings often show a disregard for perspective and anatomy and this has led to much discussion about his use of assistants. The upper part of this engaging composition is very inventive and was inspired by the sculptural reliefs of Donatello, while the lower part reflects Francesco's admiration for the work of the north Italian miniaturist Girolamo da Cremona, who worked on choirbooks in Siena from 1470 to 1474. So different in character are the upper and lower parts that they were separated in the nineteenth century; they were rejoined in 1988.",

        "Frame": "The engaged frame is from Florence and dates to about 1380–1400 (see figs. 1–3 above). This two-sided molding is made of poplar and secures the double-sided panel painting within its stepped rabbet. It is marble painted on its sides. The profile of the frame is narrower on the back where its delicate original water gilding remains visible. The heavier gesso and burnished water gilding on the front mask the profile. The carved pearls appear to be added at a later time. No hinge marks on the sides indicate that the panel was an independent object, possibly a pax.Timothy Newbery with Cynthia Moyer 2017; further information on this frame can be found in the Department of European Paintings files",
        "Notes": "This painting was made as an independent object, as suggested by the lack of hinge marks on the original frame. It may have served as a pax (or Osculatorium), a tablet used in passing the kiss of peace during the mass (see Meiss 1951). Such objects were usually made of metal, but painted ones are known. The size of the work, its hieratic quality, and the inscription are especially appropriate for this liturgical function, and the decoration on the back indicates that both sides were meant to be seen. While the image may be interpreted as showing Christ before a cloth of honor, it more likely represents Saint Veronica's veil (sudarium), miraculously imprinted with the head of the Christ during the journey to Calvary.The back is decorated with a white bordered, purple quatrefoil design on a green background. Inside the quatrefoil is a geometric configuration consisting of squares and triangles of white, purple, and black.The Master of the Orcagnesque Misericordia is the name given by Richard Offner (1981) to the painter of a Madonna of Mercy in the Galleria dell'Accademia, Florence.",
        "Intro Description": "This hypnotic panel, with its original frame, shows two angels holding the cloth on which Christ’s face was miraculously imprinted when Veronica wiped his brow on his way to his crucifixion. For centuries the portrait, indeed self-portrait, that resulted was understood as the true likeness of Christ. The miraculous picture, not made by human hands, became a foundational image for European artists. The inscription on Christ’s collar from John 14:27, \"My peace I give unto you,\" suggests that this precious painting may have been used during the celebration of Mass as a pax to pass the kiss of peace.",

        "Catalogue Entry": "According to the apocryphal Acts of Saint Paul, Saint Thecla was converted to Christianity by Saint Paul at Iconium and martyred in Seleucia. Famed for her powers of healing, she is the patron saint of Este (thirty kilometers south of Padua) and the titular saint of its cathedral. She was the object of prayers during the plague that devastated the Veneto in 1630. On June 29, 1758—almost 130 years after the event—the commune of Este provided for an altarpiece to celebrate her as the protector of the town and to serve as a fitting decoration for its new cathedral, designed early in the century by the Venetian architect Antonio Gaspari and dedicated in 1748 by Cardinal Carlo Rezzonico, bishop of Padua. This beautiful and deeply affective oil sketch, transported by Tiepolo to Spain and sold after his death to the Spanish painter Francisco Bayeu (Goya's brother-in-law), is themodellofor the altarpiece. It shows Saint Thecla praying to God for deliverance from the plague, personified by a female figure expulsed by angels in a darkened sky that contrasts with the sunlit, topographical view of Este in the background. The altarpiece, which was installed in the cathedral in the artist's presence on Christmas Eve 1759, is among the largest canvases painted by Tiepolo—it measures 675 by 390 centimeters—and can on a number of counts be considered his religious masterpiece. It is marked by a gravity and descriptive restraint that could scarcely be anticipated from the evidence of Tiepolo's earlier work: there is nothing of the demonstrative emotionalism of, for example, the S. AlviseWay to Calvaryof two decades earlier or the dramatic pathos of the more nearly contemporaryMartyrdom of Saint Agatha(Gemäldegalerie, Berlin). Whether the qualities of theSaint Theclacan be ascribed to his awareness of the current artistic climate in Rome or, as seems more likely, to renewed contact with his friend and admirer of long standing Francesco Algarotti is difficult to say. (Algarotti, who had been abroad, was again in Venice between 1754 and 1757.) That there was a conscious effort on Tiepolo's part to move his art in a fresh direction is indicated by the differences between themodelloand the finished altarpiece.It is not only in the various motifs and gestures of the Saint Thecla compositions that Tiepolo revealed a new artistic direction. In the altarpiece Tiepolo restrained his hallmark vibrato brushwork, which plays such an important part in creating the sense of fervent urgency in themodello, emphasizing instead smooth, more polished surfaces. He enlivened the uniformly low-key color scheme with almost strident accents in the final painting—particularly in Saint Thecla's vermilion cloak, which replaces the ocher one she wears in themodello. And in place of the warm, hazy, and diffuse light of the sketch, he chose a cold, directed one that casts sharp shadows and highlights details. In no earlier commission do we encounter such a marked difference in the technical means and artistic ambition of themodelloand the finished work. These features are sometimes interpreted as signaling a decline in Tiepolo's creative powers or an increased reliance on Giandomenico to carry his projects through to completion. They should, instead, alert us to his remarkable ability to respond to new cultural stimuli.[2010; adapted from Christiansen 1996]",

B. Tiepolo, 1928, vol. 2, pl. 100).Lorenzo Tiepolo made a reverse etching after the altarpiece (reproduced in Succi 1983, pp. 408–9, no. 536).",
        "Intro Description": "Tiepolo made this oil sketch in preparation for a monumental altarpiece in the cathedral at Este, in northeastern Italy, that commemorates a devastating plague in 1630. Saint Thecla prays to God, who appears in the heavens, on behalf of the city seen in the background. The figure at right covering his mouth against the stench and about to remove a mother’s body is based on works by Raphael and Nicolas Poussin, but Tiepolo depicts him as a man of African descent in a manner consistent with historical evidence. The dangerous task of handling plague‑stricken bodies was often forced on freed or enslaved African and Turkish men. Tiepolo omitted this figure in the final painting.",

        "Catalogue Entry": "These four panels are part of a series originally showing the twelve apostles of Christ. Six others are known: a Saint Philip formerly in the Lehman collection (sold, Christie's, New York, January 11, 1991, no. 12); Saints Matthew, Simon, James the Great, and Thaddeus in the National Gallery of Art, Washington; and a Saint James the Less in the Salini collection, near Siena (formerly Stoclet collection, Brussels). The series must also have included Saints Peter and John and, possibly, a Christ. They would either have formed the predella of a large altarpiece or a row of saints above the main register, as in Simone Martini's altarpiece at Pisa of 1319–20. The rows of saints in that altarpiece are shown beneath more complex, trilobite arches, probably indicating an earlier date for the series to which our panels belong. An analogy is provided by the predella of Simone Martini's altarpiece in the Museo di Capodimonte, Naples, showing Saint Louis of Toulouse, dated 1317, or an altarpiece by Duccio in the Pinacoteca, Siena, painted perhaps around 1311–19. A plausible date for the altarpiece to which our saints belonged would be around 1317–19. This must have been a large altarpiece, measuring perhaps about 100 inches (250 cm) across. None of the main panels have been identified. The poses of the various figures are animated, and various details, such as the books, are imagined as resting on the frames, which are original (their silver is tarnished). The figures were unquestionably designed and their execution supervised by Simone Martini, who ran a large and busy workshop.Keith Christiansen 2010",

All were owned by the German painter and collector Johann Anton Ramboux in the nineteenth century, and they formed either the predella or a row of figures above the main panels of an altarpiece. The saints were originally painted on one panels are original, but have been painted an anomalous brown). The figures are based on cartoons prepared by Simone in the 1320s, but the execution was certainly entrusted to assistants. The panels have suffered from past cleanings.",

        "Catalogue Entry": "This picture is one of four whaling subjects by Turner; the other three form part of the artist's bequest at Tate Britain, London. The Met's painting and another of the same title were shown at the Royal Academy in 1845, receiving a mixed reception. The third and fourth in the series—\"Hurrah! for the Whaler Erebus! Another Fish!\" andWhalers (Boiling Blubber) Entangled in Flaw Ice, Endeavouring to Extricate Themselves—were exhibited the following year.Turner’s principal literary source was Thomas Beale’sNatural History of the Sperm Whale, published in London in 1835 and in an expanded edition in 1839. Elhanan Bicknell, the first owner of The Met's painting, had made his fortune as a director of Langton and Bicknell, oil merchants of Newington Butts, whose financial interest was in ships of the Pacific sperm-whale fishery. He subscribed for four copies of Beale's book, and may have given or lent one to Turner, whose patron he already was. The artist subtitled his 1845 exhibits \"Vide Beale’s Voyage,\" referring to page 163 for the Tate’s picture and page 175 for the Met's work. For his depiction of the whale, which is clearly visible only in this canvas, Turner consulted wood engravings by William James Linton and after William Huggins that illustrate Beale’s book. Bicknell’s firm also owned a canvas by Huggins (private collection, United Kingdom), painted about 1835, that Turner must have used as a source for details in this picture and its companion.There are related watercolors on nine pages of Turner’s undated Whalers Sketchbook in the Tate (Finberg no. CCCLIII, fols. 6–14) and a separate sheet with a whaling subject is at the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge (PD.116-1950). While the watercolors are as evocative as the painting, none is closely related in thematic material, and all may in any event be later. In the 1840s, few people in England knew what a sperm whale looked like. Turner may never have seen one and, using the descriptions and illustrations that were available to him, he created these works in part from his imagination, bringing to bear many years’ observation of the seas in the Channel and elsewhere along the English coast.In April 1850, a few months after returning to New York from his first visit to London, Herman Melville ordered a copy of Beale'sNatural History of the Sperm Whale. On the title page, Melville wrote, \"Turner’s pictures of whalers were suggested by this book\", thus documenting that he knew of Turner’s paintings, even though he may never have seen them, and that he drew on Beale, as well as his own experience as a sailor and harpooner, when writingMoby-Dick, published in 1851. As Wallace (1985) has suggested, Melville may have hadWhalersin mind while describing a picture hanging in the Spouter-Inn in chapter three ofMoby-Dick.The painting, acquired by the Museum in 1896, was relined and cleaned in 1933, and treated again in 1968. The surface is flattened. The ship is considerably abraded, but some of the rigging can still be read. The best-preserved passages are the small boats and figures, the head of the whale, and the dark, choppy surrounding sea. Turner changed the contours of the whale’s nose, gradually widening and enlarging the shape. Examination under the microscope reveals the remnants of scumbles associated with the darkest gray pigment that may originally have subdued the contrast between this pigment and the surrounding areas.[2012; adapted from Baetjer 2009]",

        "References": "J. M. W. Turner. Letter to Elhanan Bicknell. January 31, 1845 [private collection, United States; copy in curatorial file], writes that \"I have a whale or two on canvas\".\"Royal Academy.\"The Times(May 6, 1845), p. 6, observes \"J.M.W. Turner … has found a new field for his peculiar style in the whale fishery ('Whalers' 50 and 77). The greater portion of the picture is one mass of white spray, which so blends with the white clouds of the sky, that the spectator can hardly separate them, while the whiteness is still continued by the sails of the ship, which are placed in defiance of contrast. The boats and boatmen are slightly indicated amid the confusion, while the whale is a large dark lump. It is not to be expected that Turner will gain any new admirers by these eccentric productions; but those who are inclined to admire him, will find enough to wonder at his free, vigorous, fearless embodiment of the effect of a moment. To do justice to Turner, it should always be remembered that he is the painter, not of reflections, but of immediate sensations\".\"Royal Academy Exhibition.\"Morning Chronicle(May 7, 1845), p. 4, writes, \"The two larger works in the great room (Nos. 50 and 77) represent two scenes of adventure in whale fishing, the one when the huge black monster is first attacked, the other when, lashing and writhing in agony, he has nearly upset the small fleet of boats which have come to molest him. The prevailing tone of both is cold, the atmosphere white and indefinite, and the square white sails of the whaler standing out against the colourless sky. The only warmth in either picture is produced by the red clothing of the sailors in the boats, a selection of colour which, on a close inspection, seems so obviously inconsistent with their vocation, that the spectator is tempted to cry 'how absurd,' and to walk away from the spot. But when he has got away some three yards, if he look back he will be astonished to find how these red tints become mellowed in their general effect, and how other rough patches of superfices seem to have melted into thin transparent air, and how in fact, by a wonderful combination of materials all his own, Mr. Turner has produced extraordinary aerial effects\".\"Fine Arts: Royal Academy Exhibition.\"The Spectator(May 10, 1845), p. 450, praises \"two of Turner’s tumultuous surges: Whalers – all light, spray, and clouds; beautiful as harmonies of colour; depicting the peril and excitement of Whale-fishing, in a vague, imaginative manner\".\"Fine Arts: Royal Academy.\"Literary Gazette(May 17, 1845), p. 314, writes \"We do not think any one but himself could have painted that phantom-ship, which, in compliment to an enormous fish (which might have entombed Jonah in a high-vaulted interior), he has called a “Whaler.” It is a vision and unreality; but the handling of the tints, and their harmony, allowing for the exalted pitch of their prismatic brightness, are astonishing. Splintered rainbows thrown against the canvass is a better comparison than the deteriorating one of lobster-sauce, which some crusty critic has applied as an accompaniment to the Leviathan. There are atmospheric effects of magical talent; but after all, we would rather possess one of Mr. Turner’s earlier works, when he did not think of subliming truth, than three of the most brilliant of these imaginations, created with all his mastery of art\".\"Fine Arts: Third Notice of the Royal Academy Exhibition. Landscape and Sea Pieces.\"The Spectator(May 24, 1845), p. 498, writes \"In the Great Room are two pair of sea-pieces by Turner: two views of Venice seen under the brightest effects of morning and evening sun that can be conceived of an Italian sky; and two scenes of whalers, in which the hues of light are of such prismatic brilliancy, that the sailors are painted of the same bright orange colour that the palaces and gondolas of Venice are decked in. As light is light all the world over, there may be times when the Northern seas welter in a flood of radiance as dazzling as that which pours down from a Southern sky; but such is not their most characteristic effect. … Turner, however, is a 'chartered libertine' in respect of local truth: he paints the elements; and the forms and hues of objects are nought in his estimation but vehicles for representing dazzling effects of light, space, and colour\".\"A Scamper through the Exhibition of the Royal Academy.\"Punch(May 31, 1845), p. 233, remarks \"No. 77 is called 'Whalers,' by J.M.W. TURNER, R.A., and embodies one of those singular effects which are only met with in lobster salads, and in this artist’s pictures. Whether he calls his picture 'Whalers,' or 'Venice,' or 'Morning,' or 'Noon,' or 'Night,' it is all the same; for it is quite easy to fancy it one thing as another\".Michel Angelo Titmarsh [William Makepeace Thackeray]. \"Picture Gossip.\"Fraser's Magazine(June 1845), pp. 720–21, writes \"[Turner] is as great as usual, vibrating between the absurd and the sublime, until the eye grows dazzled in watching him, and can’t really tell in what region he is. If Etty’s colour is wild and mysterious, looking here as if smeared with the finger, and there with the palette-knife, what can be said about Turner? Go up and look at one of his pictures, and you laugh at yourself and at him, and at the picture, and that wonderful amateur who is invariably found to give a thousand pounds for it, or more—some sum wild, prodigious, unheard-of, monstrous, like the picture itself. All about [Turner] is a mysterious extravaganza; price, poem, purchaser, picture. Look at the latter for a little time, and it begins to affect you too,—to mesmerize you. It is revealed to you; and, as it is said in the East, the magicians make children see the sultana, carpet-bearers, tents, &c., in a spot of ink in their hands; so the magician, Joseph Mallard [sic], makes you see what he likes on a board, that to the first view is merely dabbed over with occasionally [sic] streaks of yellow, and flecked here and there with vermilion. The vermilion blotches become little boats full of harpooners and gondolas, with a deal of music going on on board. That is not a smear of purple you see yonder, but a beautiful whale, whose tail has just slapped a half-dozen whale-boats into perdition; and as for what you fancied to be a few zig-zig lines spattered on the canvass at haphazard, look! they turn out to be a ship with all her sails; the captain and his crew are clearly visible in the ship’s bows; and you may distinctly see the oil-casks getting ready under the superintendence of that man with the red whiskers and the cast in his eye; who is, of course, the chief mate. In a word, I say that Turner is a great and awful mystery to me\"\r\n.John James Ruskin. Letter to John Ruskin. September 19, 1845 [see Ref. Shapiro 1972], writes that \"[Bicknell] found Water Colour in Whalers [probably this picture] & rubbed out some with Handky. He went to Turner who looked Daggers & refused to do anything, but at last he has taken it back to alter. Roberts admires the picture but all say it is not finished. They account for his hurry & disregard for future fame by putting Water Colours by his stronger passion, love of money.

        "Notes": "According to Haden (1887), the painting belonged to H. A. J. Munro of Novar, although none of the Christie's catalogues in which the painting was offered (1851, 1858, 1874, 1875, 1883, and 1891) mention him as a previous owner.Although Ruskin 1845 suggests that Turner may have employed watercolors in this painting, no traces have been found in any paintings that have been examined. Joyce Townsend, in her study of Turner’s painting techniques, writes that the comments of some of the artist’s contemporaries indicate that he used watercolor medium when completing his pictures on Varnishing Days (the day before the opening of an exhibition, when artists could varnish their paintings or add final touches). Townsend concludes, \"Some of the highly thinned paint which Turner used looks like watercolor medium, but in fact none was found—or none has survived—on any of the finished paintings\" examined in her study. (Townsend,Turner’s Painting Techniques, London, 1993, p. 53).",
        "Intro Description": "Turner was seventy years old whenWhalersdebuted to mixed reviews at the Royal Academy exhibition of 1845. Its subject proved elusive, as the English novelist William Thackeray observed: \"That is not a smear of purple you see yonder, but a beautiful whale, whose tail has just slapped a half-dozen whale-boats into perdition; and as for what you fancied to be a few zig-zag lines spattered on the canvas at hap-hazard, look! they turn out to be a ship with all her sails.\" Apparently Turner undertook the painting—which was returned to him—for the collector Elhanan Bicknell, who had made his fortune in the whale-oil business.",

        "Catalogue Entry": "The Artist:Frits Thaulow was in the vanguard of artists who adapted and promoted the dynamic approach to landscape painting pioneered by French Realists and Impressionists in the 1860s and 1870s. Thaulow’s naturalistic depictions of the countryside in his native Norway and in France brought together progressive tendencies in Norwegian and French art. He also bridged artistic communities in the two countries through the personal and professional connections he created and fostered among others. Over the course of his career, Thaulow travelled and exhibited widely in Europe and the United States, forming a large circle of artist friends whose work he encouraged and collected. His insider status in the elite art world is encapsulated by the fact that he was related by marriage to both Paul Gauguin and Edvard Munch.In the early 1870s, Thaulow studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Copenhagen, with the Danish marine painter Carl Frederik Sørensen (1818–1879), and with the Norwegian landscapist Hans Gude (1825–1903). In 1874, he traveled to Paris, where he spent considerable time up to 1879, coinciding with the years of the early Impressionist movement. In the summer of 1879, Thaulow pivoted back to Scandinavia. The artist’s return to his roots was inaugurated by a stay with his compatriot Christian Krohg at Skagen, a village on the Danish coast that hosted an influential artists’ colony that was an incubator for innovative Nordic painting (see The Met2020.84.3). During the next thirteen years, Thaulow was essential to the growth of Norway’s artistic institutions and to the development of new and direct interpretations of nature inspired by French exemplars ofplein-airpainting (painting outdoors before the motif). He continued to exhibit and spend time in France, and, on the heels of successful showings at the Exposition Universelle in Paris in 1889 and at the Salon du Champs de Mars in 1890 and 1891, he moved permanently to France in 1892. Here, his fortunes blossomed, as he trained his eyes on the northern French landscape and the Channel coast. It was at this time that he cemented friendships with luminaries such as Claude Monet and Auguste Rodin.The Site:Vidar Poulsson formerly identified this painting with a picture exhibited at the Grafton Galleries in London in 1908 under the titleLe Village - Montreuiland dated about 1894 (Poulsson 1994). Montreuil-sur-Mer (sometimes simply called Montreuil) lies on the river Canche at the northern tip of France, a locale that Thaulow frequented. However, Poulsson noted that the view does not resemble Montreuil (Poulsson 2006), and, when the present work came to auction in 2020, he pinpointed the site as the village of Picquigny, which lies some fifty miles to the south, along the river Somme near Amiens (see Flatmo 2020). The street in the middle distance is the rue du Guindal, also called le Guindal. A woman with a white cap and a basket stands on the road, conversing with a man wearing a gray hat and carrying a walking stick. The word “Hôtel” is visible on the façade of one building, and below it may be the phrase “des Voyageurs.”[1] The walls of the medieval château de Picquigny, the town’s main landmark, are just visible through the trees at the upper left. To the right is the Tour Saint Jean, the bell tower of the church of Saint Jean-Baptiste. The short, pyramidal roof depicted in the painting was built after the eighteenth-century cupola and campanile were destroyed in a storm on the night of December 6, 1859. About a century later, the Tour Saint-Jean was damaged by bombardments during World War II, and the entire building was demolished in the 1950s.[2] The small copse on the right bank of the river is the edge of an area known asl’Abreuvoir(a watering place for livestock). Thaulow placed his easel on a section of the curving riverbank that had been built up during the construction of the nearby railroad tracks and bridge, creating an elevated vantage point with a view over the water (Delory 2021). The yellow, brown, and orange tints to the foliage indicate that the season is autumn.The Painting Campaign:Thaulow traveled to Picquigny on a painting expedition that lasted from late October to November 11, 1899, when he returned to his studio in Paris. The artist hoped to visit Norway during this period, but in a letter to the author Amalie Skram on November 10, he wrote, “I do not have time . . . and my dealers give me good money to stay [in France] and work” (quoted in Poulsson 2006, p. 114). Thaulow was then under contract with Isidore Montaignac, who was affiliated with Georges Petit, one of the leading galleries in Paris, which that summer had hosted a major exhibition of work by Thaulow, Monet, and Alfred Sisley.[3] According to Montaignac, under the terms of their agreement, Thaulow committed to producing a certain number of paintings per year, which his dealers had the exclusive right to market.[4]Thaulow’s excursion to Picquigny nearly derailed at the outset. According to the period press, residents of the small village suspected that the tall, blond stranger speaking accented French was a Prussian spy. He had to be “rescued” by the intervention of a British painter who recognized and vouched for him.[5] Despite this inauspicious start, the painting campaign seems to have yielded a number of works, including one now in the Musée de Reims and a variant of it in a private collection (see Poulsson 1994, p. 136 and Poulsson 2006, p. 114). Two additional paintings titledPéquignyappear in theCatalogue des Tableaux provenant de l’atelier Frits Thaulow, Galerie Georges Petit, Paris, May 6–7, 1907, nos. 16 and 36.Thaulow was known for his dedication to painting outdoors, but, at this stage in his career, he was inclined to work in his studio and from memory.[6] It is not yet known to what extent this scene and his other views of Picquigny were painted on site, and the degree to which they were worked up later. Close examination shows thatPicquignywas painted in at least three sessions, with enough time for the paint to set in between them. Due to the size of the present canvas, Poulsson suggests that Thaulow may have intended to exhibit it at the Exposition Universelle in Paris in 1900, where the artist served as Norwegian commissioner. However, the roster of paintings that he displayed is not clear. Only two paintings are listed in the exhibition catalogue, but a review mentions additional works by Thaulow, including one calledAu bord de la Somme.[7]Composition and Style:At Le Guindal, the river courses quickly and is full of eddies. These conditions were ideally suited to Thaulow, who, with the encouragement of Montaignac, had cultivated a reputation for capturing the movement of water.[8] Rural riverscapes were the foundation of the artist’s repertoire. Having spent much of the summer of 1899 in Venice, amidst the dazzling light and color of the canals, he was primed to turn fresh eyes on the Somme. In this scene, he adopted one of his trademark compositional strategies, positioning the viewer slightly above and in the middle of the river, and employing a foreshortened perspective that amplifies the proximity of the water. This method emphasizes the swirling current and the artist’s skill in evoking its ever-changing colors, reflections, and illumination. Similar views of the river around Picquigny may be seen in period photographic postcards (see fig. 1 above).Thaulow’s sensitive and detailed portrayal of nature, with its rich, dark tones and muted light, is rooted in the tradition of northern Romantic landscape painting, and especially the work of Norwegian predecessors such as Johan Christian Dahl and Thomas Fearnley (see The Met2009.400.32and2020.84.1). In an interview in 1900, Thaulow acknowledged their \"enduring influence\" on his generation of artists.[9] At the same time, Thaulow’s painting owes much to contemporary French art and particularly to the landscapes of Pissarro (see The Met51.30.2) and the riverscapes of Monet (see The Met56.135.4). In its skillful adaption and synthesis of different stylistic inspirations, Picquigny exemplifies the distinctive sensibility that Thaulow brought to the depiction of nature.Alison Hokanson 2021[1] I am grateful to Frank Claustrat for his insights into the inscription. I have not yet been able to determine if there was a hotel by that name in Picquigny around 1900.[2] J. P.

September 25, 2020, states that Poulsson has identified the location as Picquigny, rather than Montreuil, and that he has redated the picture later, to the time of Thaulow's trip to the area.Blomqvist 150 Ar Jubileumsauksjon.  Blomqvist Kunsthandel.  October 20, 2020, unpaginated, no. 24, ill. (color), states that the correct title for the work is \"Picquigny,\" after a village northwest of Amiens Thaulow visited in November 1899, and that the work can be dated with certainty, therefore, to that year; cites both Paris 1917 and photography of the same exhibition as corroborating the title; notes that the mistaken title \"Le Village—Montreuil\" and date of about 1894 derived from a Grafton Gallery, London, 1908 exhibition formerly associated with the work.Jean Pierre Delory.

        "Intro Description": "Thaulow earned great success with his depictions of the rivers and byways of northern France. This canvas shows the village of Picquigny, near Amiens on the river Somme, where the Norwegian painter worked for several weeks in the late autumn of 1899. The composition adopts a downward vantage point that emphasizes the eddying water and its ever-changing colors, reflections, and illumination. Thaulow’s excursion was part of a characteristically ambitious professional schedule, including a summer exhibition with his friend Monet, an extended trip to Venice, and serving as Norway’s commissioner at the 1900 World’s Fair, held in his adopted hometown of Paris.",
