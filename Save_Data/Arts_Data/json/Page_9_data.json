        "Title:": "Abraham's Parting from the Family of Lot",
        "Artist:": "Jan Victors (Dutch, Amsterdam 1619–1676/77 East Indies)",
        "Date:": "ca. 1655–65",
        "Medium:": "Oil on canvas",

        "Object Number:": "71.170",
        "Catalogue Entry": "For at least one hundred twenty years, this late work by Victors was thought to represent Jacob and Laban. Its far less familiar subject, first identified by Manuth (1987), is actually Abraham's departure for Canaan, leaving Lot and his family, who will set off for Sodom (Genesis 13). Victors's Old Testament pictures can require close reading, occasionally because of free interpretation, but more often because of unexpected subject matter. It seems likely that the artist's orthodox Calvinist beliefs, and like-minded patrons, directed him to certain biblical passages, much as they required him to avoid others.Abraham and his nephew Lot (whose father, Haran, has died) have journeyed from Egypt to the plain of Jordan, where there is a dispute between their respective herdsmen about grazing land. Abraham generously tells Lot to choose whatever territory he would prefer: \"Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen; for we be brethren. Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left\" (Genesis 13:8–9).In the painting, Lot's well-known strain of weakness is written plainly on his face and in his posture. Like his daughters, who will eventually seduce him (Genesis 19:31–35), Lot sits idly at the dinner table (not mentioned in the Bible), while Abraham, in a fur-lined robe, gestures with Mosaic decisiveness. Lot's wife, who later becomes the pillar of salt, appears to smile at the patriarch's largess. In the background, herders debate the issue, while sheep as thick as cotton graze the land that was \"not able to bear them\" (Genesis 13:6).Victors's late work reveals little stylistic development, although there is a falling off of quality at the end. This canvas, which is characteristically oversize, probably dates from about 1655–65.[2016; adapted from Liedtke 2007]",

The artist spent the better part of his stay in Naples crippled by dysentery, and few sketches remain from this period of his journey, which lasted approximately one month. In the artist’s posthumous atelier sale this sketch was entitled \"Environs de Naples\"; it shows a view of the Bay of Naples from Pozzuoli. Two of four other drawings that are identified as having been made at Pozzuoli also bear a date, October 22, 1844, thus providing the likely date for this sketch, too (see Valentina Anker,Alexandre Calame [1810–1864]: dessins, catalogue raisonné, Bern, 2000, pp. 486–87, nos. 357–60, ill.). Two oils, both lost but known through reproductive lithographs, also derive from Calame’s visit there:Ruines d’un amphithéâtre à Pouzzoles (royaume de Naples), described as an \"esquisse peinte,\" andSouvenir de Pouzzoles, described as an \"esquisse\" (see Anker,Alexandre Calame, vie et oeuvre: Catalogue raisonné de l’oeuvre peint, Fribourg, 1987, pp. 366–67, nos. 263 and 269).In a lengthy letter to his early patron John Revilliod (dated October 17, 19, 23, and 24, 1844, and received on November 16), Calame wrote of his experience of the Bay of Naples: \"I say that I know it [only] a little because until now I have seen only a part of the gulf, Pozzuoli, Baia, the Cape of Misenus, Procida, and finally Ischia, where I am now. It delighted me at first sight; this brilliant light, these picturesque buildings [fabriques], the blue sea and the extreme clarity of the air give one a sense of ease.

        "Intro Description": "Fungai's mature style reflects his awareness of the work of Umbrian artists active in Siena in the last decade of the fifteenth century. The present picture seems to date after 1500 and repeats features of an altarpeice in the cathedral at Chiusi. The landscape, however, is more elaborate. A good deal of Fungai's work depends for its effect on his skillful handling of gilt ornament and delicately rendered details. In the present picture these passages have been sadly compromised by abrasion and over-cleaning.",

The more than 150 copies can be divided into two groups, possibly reflecting two separate prototypes: those which—like this one—include the Virgin, Christ, Joseph of Arimathea, and John the Evangelist, and a second group, which omits the figure of Saint John.Ringbom (1965/86) points out that the physical type of the Virgin in the four-figure composition is close to her characterization in Rogier's polyptych of the Last Judgment (Hôtel Dieu, Beaune), while her gesture and appearance in the three-figure composition more closely reflect her representation in the Crucifixion triptych (Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna); both works are generally placed in the 1440s and a Rogierian prototype, therefore, might date from these years. For Ringbom and other authors, these copies are of special interest, not only in their reference back to a presumed lost original (or originals) by Rogier, but because they occupy \"a crucial place in the history of the half-length narrative\" (Ringbom, p. 119).[Davies (1972) suggests that Rogier's prototype might be identfiable with the four-figure Deposition ascribed to him in the inventory of paintings presented to the Escorial by Philip II in 1574: \"Another painting of the Deposition, with our Lady and Saint John and Nicodemus, by Master Rogier, with two inscribed wings, which are from Queen Mary: two feet high and one and a half feet in width, without the wings; rounded at the top.\" In the absence of the actual picture, the accuracy of the attribution to Rogier cannot be confirmed, although Davies points out that the Deposition and Crucifixion recorded in the same inventory (now respectively in the Prado and Escorial, Madrid) are clearly identifiable and autograph works.]Because five copies of the four-figure composition survived until recently in Bruges, many authors have suggested that its original was there. The wings with saints or inscriptions that flank some of these compositions are not thought to be part of Rogier's original conception. In addition to our altarpiece, five other Deposition triptychs—apparently all four-figured—have survived that include wings with Nicodemus and Mary Magdalen in the same poses (see Stroo and Syfer d'Olne 1996, p. 202). Based on their costumes, these saints must have been introduced into the composition in the course of the 16th century. The other triptychs are in: the Musées des Beaux-Arts, Brussels; Museu de Arte Sacra, Funchal (Madeira); formerly Residence Saint-Joseph, Bruges; art market, London; and Berlin (sale November 18–19, 1938, nos. 145–46; formerly Doisteau collection, Paris).Bibliography related to the Descent From the Cross composition:Salomon Reinach. \"A Lost Picture by Rogier van der Weyden,\"Burlington Magazine153 (November 1923), pp. 214–21Édouard Salin. \"Copies ou variations anciennes d'une oeuvre perdue de Rogier van der Weyden,\"Gazette des beaux-arts14 (1935), pp. 15–26Sixten Ringbom.Icon to Narrative, 1983 (1st published 1965), pp. 118–25Max J.

        "Intro Description": "The Master of the Holy Blood, an uninventive and repetitive artist who appears to have been trained in Antwerp and to have settled in Bruges, takes his name from a Lamentation altarpiece in the Heilig Bloedmuseum, Bruges. The center panel of the present work is a late reflection of a lost but often copiedDescent from the Crossby Rogier van der Weyden. To this essentially fifteenth-century composition have been added wings with individual saints that show the influence of the early-sixteenth-century Antwerp painter, Quentin  Massys. There is in-painting along several vertical splits and joins which had separated, particularly in the center panel.",

        "Catalogue Entry": "Born in Paris, Jean Laurent Mosnier trained at the Académie de Saint-Luc and became a master there in 1766. He attracted the attention of the court and painted Marie Antoinette in 1776. He became a member of the Académie Royale in 1788 but was one of the first French artists to immigrate to England on the outbreak of the French Revolution. After exhibiting at the Royal Academy from London addresses between 1791 and 1796, Mosnier went to Hamburg and then to Russia, where he entered the service of Alexander I (1777–1825). He died in St. Petersburg. Nine miniatures by Mosnier—of which four are dated—are in the Louvre.Leo R. Schidlof (The Miniature in Europe in the 16th, 17th, 18th, and 19th Centuries, Graz, 1964, vol. 2, p. 574) records that Mosnier was called the Roslin of miniature painting (after Alexandre Roslin [1718–1793]) because of his skill in rendering silk, a feature apparent in this portrait. In spite of the supposed signature, some doubts have been expressed about the authorship of this miniature. Pierrette Jean-Richard (1995) does not think it is in Mosnier's style. Gerrit Walczak (2002), however, attributes it to Mosnier and considers it the latest known work by that artist.The sitter wears the blue ribbon and badge of the Order of the Saint-Esprit, and the red ribbon and badge of the Order of Saint-Louis. The costume is identical to that worn by Louis XVI in a miniature attributed to Antoine François Callet (1741–1823) also in The Met (32.75.10).[2016; adapted from Reynolds and Baetjer 1996]",

        "Catalogue Entry": "These five panels are from a major altarpiece signed by Giovanni di Paolo and dated 1454. In the event that two of the saints—Augustine and Nicholas of Tolentino—are shown wearing the black, leather-belted habit of the Augustinian order (Augustine also wears a bishop's cope to signify his status as Bishop of Hippo, and next to him stands a figure probably intended to be his mother, Saint Monica), the altarpiece must have been painted for an Augustinian church. Giovanni di Paolo frequently worked for this order. Two suggested possibilities are the church of Sant'Agostino, Siena, or Sant'Agostino, Cortona. The latter possibility is based on the fact that The Met's altarpiece is documented as coming from the collection of Count Luigi Tommasi-Aleotti (modern spelling Aliotti) in Cortona. The Tommasi were prominent merchants in fifteenth-century Cortona, and they are known to have built a chapel in Sant'Agostino. One of them was named Niccolò, which could explain the inclusion of Saint Nicholas of Tolentino, who was canonized in 1446. However, we also know that in 1450 another merchant from Cortona, Zaccaria degli Bencivenni, endowed a chapel dedicated to Saint John the Baptist in the same church. Saint John the Baptist is prominent in the altarpiece and Bencivenni is another candidate for the patron (Gordon 2003).The altarpiece is not complete: it would have had pinnacles, a predella, and flanking piers, probably decorated with saints. The pinnacles have been identified with a series of the four evangelists and a figure of the blessing Christ (formerly Chiaramonte Bordonaro, Palermo, now in the Salini collection near Siena; see Christiansen 1982). An earlier proposal associating two panels with miracles of Saint Nicholas of Tolentino (Philadelphia Museum of Art and Akademie der bildenden Künste, Vienna) with the predella (Zeri and Gardner 1980) has now been discarded. Far more likely is the suggestion that the predella consisted of four scenes illustrating the life of Saint John the Baptist (National Gallery, London; for a full discussion and reconstruction of the altarpiece, see Gordon 2003, Fahy 2009, and fig. 1 above). That the predella illustrated the life of Saint John the Baptist indicates that the altar was, indeed, dedicated to that saint, hence the interest of the Bencivenni-endowed chapel. The predella series is among the finest achievements of the artist, and the altarpiece as a whole was an important one.Keith Christiansen 2011",

        "Frame": "The altarpiece lacks its pinnacles (probably of half-length figures of the Evangelists), flanking piers, and predella of small, narrative scenes.

        "Intro Description": "This multipanel altarpiece (polyptych) was painted to decorate a chapel in a church belonging to the Augustinian order, possibly in Cortona. Saint Nicholas of Tolentino, canonized in 1446, appears on the far right wearing the Augustinian habit. The altarpiece would have been completed with five pinnacles showing the evangelists and Christ, a base (predella) showing the history of Saint John the Baptist, and pilasters with small figures of saints. The highly stylized figures and gold background mimic an older artistic approach, indicating Giovanni’s preference for the work of his great fourteenth-century forebears.",

        "Object Number:": "41.100.5",
        "Catalogue Entry": "The Sitter:The sitter of this distinguished portrait is a member of a prestigious Catholic military order, the Knights of Malta (also known as the Knights Hospitallers or of St. John of Jerusalem), and wears its distinctive white cross on his garment. He appears to turn toward the viewer, interrupted in his reading of a sheet of paper with crisp folds whose blank side is turned to the viewer. An inscription at the lower right indicates that the portrait was painted in 1566 and that the sitter was twenty-nine years old. The date is of consequence, as it is the year following the so-called Great Siege of Malta, when the Ottoman Empire attacked the Mediterranean island but was repulsed by the Knights, who withstood the attack on their stronghold. The Siege was commemorated as one of the most significant events of the sixteenth century, with Voltaire once writing, \"Nothing is better known than this siege, where Suleiman’s fortunes ran aground.\" (See Bruce Ware Allen,The Great Siege of Malta. The Epic Battle Between the Ottoman Empire and the Knights of St. John, Lebanon, N.H., 2015, p. 266).A copy of the painting (private collection) has made the identification of the sitter possible. This canvas includes a view of the castle of Magione through a window at the right (see figs. 1–4 above). Built in the eleventh century, this castle and church complex near Poggibonsi (Siena) and on the important pilgrimage route known as the Via Francigena belonged to the Knights beginning in 1312. In 1566, it was under the jurisdiction of Fra Bernardo Salviati (1508–1568), Grand Prior of Rome of the Order of Malta and member of one of the grandest Florentine families. He frequented Magione often, organizing hunting parties there. The Met’s painting almost certainly represents Fra Bernardo’s nephew and heir, Fra Jacopo Salviati, born in 1537 (and thus 29 in 1566), with the copy adding additional visual information about the sitter’s status, family, and attachment to the Order’s centers in Tuscany (written communications, Marquis Cremona-Barbaro and Professor Giovanni Riganelli, 2014).Members of the Salviati family were enormously important patrons of the arts in Florence and Rome in the sixteenth century. Both Jacopo’s father, Alamanno, and his uncle Cardinal Giovanni were principal patrons of the painter Francesco de’ Rossi, known as Francesco Salviati, who took this name when part of Cardinal Giovanni’s household in Rome. The artist’s only extant letter was written at the end of his life in 1563 to Fra Jacopo Salviati, who was also his patron. (SeeFrancesco Salviati (1510–1563), o la Bella Maniera, ed. Catherine Monbeig Goguel, exh. cat., Villa Medici, Rome. Milan, 1998, p. 26 and passim, and pp. 336–37, no. 143).The Attribution:This identification also adds weight to the recent attribution of the work to the Florentine Mirabello Cavalori tentatively suggested by Marta Privitera (1995, 1996), and then in a letter by Larry Feinberg (2000). Soon after the painting appeared in Rome in 1910, various authors, including F. Mason Perkins (1914) and Ellis Waterhouse (1930), attributed it to El Greco and suggested that the Spanish artist painted it during his Roman period. Although this attribution was sometimes accepted, once the painting entered The Met scholars began to shift focus to Italian painters, including Jacopino del Conte (who was in Rome from the 1540s; see Salinger 1944) and then the Bolognese painter Bartolomeo Passerotti (Zeri 1986).D. Stephen Pepper (1995) reoriented the discussion to suggest that the painter came instead from among the so-called Studiolo artists, the group of painters that worked for Duke Francesco I de’ Medici in his private chamber in the Palazzo Vecchio in Florence beginning in 1570. Of these, Pepper focused on Girolamo Macchietti (1535–1592), comparing the painted portrait to various drawings attributed to him. Visual connections are even closer with Macchietti’s friend Mirabello Cavalori, as suggested by Privitera and Feinberg. Compelling comparisons can be made to portraits such as aPortrait of a Man(Galleria Palatina, Florence, inv. 1912, no. 238), which combines a similar austerity of presentation with a distinctive play of the hands, and to the figures in Mirabello’s most important works, the two paintings he did for Duke Francesco’s Studiolo. The biographer Giorgio Vasari, who knew the artist and his work firsthand, singled out the quality of his portraits, noting that Cavalori portrayed Francesco I more than once and that many other of his portraits were in \"the hands of various gentlemen of Florence\" (Lives of the Painters, Sculptors and Architects, trans. Gaston du C. de Vere, vol. 2., New York, 1996, p. 880). It remains to be discovered whether Fra Jacopo commissioned other works from the artists who dominated the Florentine scene in the years following the death of Jacopo Pontormo (1556) and during Agnolo Bronzino’s less productive last years (d. 1573).Andrea Bayer 2016",

The sitter is almost certainly the Florentine Fra Jacopo Salviati (b. 1537), who was the nephew and heir to the Grand Prior of Rome, one of the Order’s highest officers. It was painted in 1566, the year following the Great Siege of Malta, when Ottoman troops attempted to conquer the island and the Knights who ruled it, but were repulsed. The artist is probably the talented Mirabello Cavalori, one of a generation of Florentine artists who sought to infuse a greater naturalness into the formal conventions of portraiture of the time.The splendid frame is of the period and possibly original to the picture.",

        "Catalogue Entry": "This miniature is from a series of eight portraits arranged as two bracelets (26.168.63–70). The catch of one bracelet is marked ET once; that of the other is marked ET twice. This mark was used in France after 1838 for gold articles of foreign manufacture. The bracelets were received at the Museum as works of the French school of the eighteenth century. It was reasonable to suppose that the miniatures represent members of the same family and on the basis of costume they were thought likely to date between 1785 and 1800. The arrangement was not the original one, since the French mounts were made some forty years later. Richard Allen first proposed that the miniatures might be German, which is very likely given Bodo Hofstetter's recent identification of two of the sitters as Anton (1755–1836) and Maximilian (1759–1838), younger brothers of Frederick Augustus (1750–1827), elector and from 1806 king of Saxony.Anton is probably represented with his second wife Maria Therese of Habsburg (1767–1827), whom he married in 1787 (26.168.64). Between 1795 and 1799 the couple's four children died at birth or in early childhood. Maximilian married in 1792 as his first wife Caroline Maria Therese of Parma (1770–1804). Their three sons and four daughters were born between 1794 and 1803; among these seven children are probably the four (26.168.65, 66, 69, 70) represented here. The identification of Caroline of Parma (26.168.68) is the most certain as the miniature is based on her wedding portrait of 1792 by Anton Graff (Schloss Pilnitz, Dresden), where she has the same brown eyes and wears the same diamond tiara and diamond bowknot pin. For this and other related works by Graff, see Julius Vogel,Anton Graff, Leipzig, 1898, pp. 23–25, fig. 9, pls. 5–7, and Richard Muther,Anton Graff, Leipzig, 1881, pp. 74, 76, 77.Given the discrepancy in scale and style between the male portraits and the others, the miniatures may have been painted over several years by more than one artist. It is possible that the couples are not correctly paired, as Anton had blue eyes (26.168.67) and Maximilian (26.168.63) had gray eyes; the two wore the same orders and decorations. The children cannot be specifically identified.[2016; adapted from Reynolds and Baetjer 1996]",

        "Catalogue Entry": "The Artist:One of the leading figures of Venetian painting, Carpaccio is above all famous for his large decorative cycles undertaken for the various confraternities, orscuolein the city: the cycle of the life of Saint Ursula for the Scuola di S. Orsola (1490–95); that with scenes from the lives of Saints Jerome, Augustine, and George for the Scuola di S. Giorgio degli Schiavoni (1502–ca. 1508); and that dedicated to Saint Stephen for the Scuola degli Albanesi (ca. 1500–1510). These show a narrative invention and a richness of detail that he brought as well to his devotional paintings, of which The Metropolitan Museum’sMeditation on the Passion of Christis among his masterpieces. The naturalistic detail of these paintings was especially admired by the great nineteenth-century critic John Ruskin. Perhaps his most significant altarpiece, of the Presentation in the Temple, dates from 1510 and was painted for the church of San Giobbe (Accademia, Venice). He was admired as a portraitist but few survive: the outstanding example is his portrait of a knight in the Museo Thyssen-Bornemisza, Madrid, of 1510. His early style is much indebted to the example of Giovanni Bellini, and his later work reveals an attempt to respond to the great atmospheric unity and chromatic richness of the works of Giorgione and Titian—yet the consistency of his style is such that it is not always easy to date his most individual works, including The Met’s painting.The Picture:The first record of this picture, a keystone in the history of devotional painting in fifteenth-century Venice, is in 1632, when it is listed in the collection of Roberto Canonici in Ferrara. At the time, it bore a spurious signature identifying it as the work of Andrea Mantegna; the signature was removed in 1945 (see Pease 1945). Another picture by Carpaccio, showing the Entombment of Christ (now in the Gemäldegalerie, Berlin)—but on canvas and measuring 145 x 185 cm—was also owned by Canonici and also bore a false Mantegna signature. Whether the two pictures were painted for the same foundation, such as a confraternity, and where such an institution may have been, has been much discussed (Hartt 1992 and Blass-Simmen 1993). They do not seem to be contemporary—the Berlin painting is unquestionably later—but their themes are related. Moreover, they have in common that they were not conceived as traditional illustrations of a canonical event from the life of Christ, but are set in an extensive landscape incorporating details intended as prompts that would actively engage the viewer/worshipper’s imagination, who would bring to bear his or her familiarity with exegetical and devotional literature and practice—an extension of thedevotio moderno, with its emphasis on the interior life of the devout and perhaps best exemplified by Thomas à Kempis’s widely readThe Imitation of Christ(ca. 1418). In their discursive, poetical approach, the two paintings are products of a new kind of devotional painting, the origins of which are to be found in the work of Giovanni Bellini (see Keith Christiansen, \"Bellini and the Meditational poesia,\"Artibus et Historiae, Art in Sixteenth-Century Venice: Context, Practices, Developments: Proceedings of a Conference in Honour of Peter Humfrey[University of Saint Andrews, May 3–6, 2012], part 1, no. 67 [XXIV], 2013, pp. 9–20).In 1940 Frederick Hartt wrote an article that remains the basis of all subsequent interpretations of The Met's picture. He identified the two figures flanking Christ as the great early Christian theologian Jerome (ca. 347–420) and the Old Testament prophet Job, who in Venice had the unusual status of a saint to which a major Franciscan church was dedicated (San Giobbe). Jerome is easily identified by his constant companion, the lion, shown in the background, before the cave opening. A rosary of vertebrae hangs from a marble pedestal on which two books rest (one is open). These are objects of devotional prayer and meditation, and the saint’s gaze, directed toward the viewer, makes him the key to the theme of the picture: he is the exemplar of the penitent viewer/worshipper contemplating the picture as well as the guide to its exegetical interpretation. Job can be identified by his similarity to the figure in Giovanni Bellini’s altarpiece painted for the church of San Giobbe (now in the Gallerie dell’Accademia, Venice). Hartt associated the theme of the picture with a well-known passage from the book of Job (19:25–26)—\" I know that my redeemer lives, and that in the end he will stand on the earth\"—and with Saint Jerome’s commentary on that book that occurs in a letter written to his follower Paulinus (the letter is quoted below). Hartt read the letters on the fractured marble base upon which Job sits as \"Israel,\" \"that my redeemer liveth,\" and \"19,\" referring to the passage from Job. He also believed that the letters on the fragmented backrest of the marble throne could be read: \"Israel\" and \"crown.\" \"Crown\" would refer to the crown of thorns that rests against the base of the throne, while \"Israel\" would refer to Christ sitting on the throne of Israel. However, in 2013 a detailed re-examination of the inscriptions was kindly undertaken by Evelyn Cohen, who contacted other leading Hebrew scholars, working with Andrea Bayer and Dorothy Mahon at The Met. Their examination confirms that the letters are, in fact, mostly pseudo-Hebrew. Only the word \"Israel,\" found on both the throne and the base on which Job sits, can be identified with certainty. These Hebrew scholars have noted that the word \"Israel\" does not appear in the book of Job. Thus the texts on which Hartt based his interpretation are not confirmed by the lettering.Yet, despite the absence of the inscribed texts, Hartt was surely correct in his understanding of the painting. Jerome commented on Job 19:25 in the letter (LIII) to Paulinus, bishop of Nola: \"Then, as for Job, that pattern of patience, what mysteries are there not contained in his discourses? Commencing in prose the book soon glides into verse and at the end once more reverts to prose. By the way in which it lays down propositions, assumes postulates, adduces proofs, and draws inferences, it illustrates all the laws of logic. Single words occurring in the book are full of meaning. To say nothing of other topics, it prophesies the resurrection of men’s bodies at once with more clearness and with more caution than any one has yet shewn. 'I know,' Job says, 'that my redeemer liveth, and that at the last day I shall rise again from the earth; and I shall be clothed again with my skin, and in my flesh shall I see God. Whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another. This my hope is stored up in my own bosom.'\" (see Philip Schaff, ed.,The Principal Works of St. Jerome, 1892, letter LIII, p. 99)As Hartt observed, the themes of Death and Resurrection are also developed in the landscape, which contrasts a barren hill above the cave (or tomb) opening on the left with the lush landscape and city view on the right. He also noted a contrast between the dead tree and the thriving plants, among which is perched a goldfinch, symbolic, like the upward-flying bird, of the Resurrection. On the left a leopard has captured a doe and is watched by a wolf while a doe or fawn grazes below. On the right a stag escapes a leopard. As noted by Gentili (1991), the leopard has the spots of a sinner, while the significance of the stag derives from Psalm 42:1–2: \"As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God. My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God: when shall I come and appear before God?\" Two rabbits and a weasel as well as a red parrot are seen in the grass. The figures promenading in the landscape wear turbans and are evidently intended to refer to infidels. The viewer/worshipper takes in these details one by one and then connects them through association with literary texts and devotional practice.The Berlin painting takes as its subject the preparation of Christ’s body for burial, but it elaborates this theme as an episodic narrative incorporating meditational motifs (for a particularly detailed analysis of this picture, see Mori 1990). In the foreground, immediately behind a ridge of rocks, with a stalk of hollyhock—often a symbol of Salvation—Christ’s body is prominently laid out on a marble slab (the stone of unction, a venerated red marble slab that was brought to Constantinople in the twelfth century; Andrea Mantegna’sDead Christin the Pinacoteca di Brera, Milan, is the most famous depiction of Christ’s dead body laid out for ceremonial anointment). The setting is a valley strewn with broken funerary monuments, bones, and decomposing bodies—a cemetery—thereby introducing the theme of death and the passage of time. In the background, to one side, two turbaned figures laboriously open the tomb in which Christ’s body will be placed while a third—Joseph of Arimathea—sets down a basin of water to wash his body, thereby connecting the figure of Christ in the foreground with the narrative based on the Gospel account (Mark 15:42-47). On the other side are the mourning figures of two Maries and Saint John. A hermit figure—as in The Met's painting, it is evidently the Old Testament Job—sits in contemplation beneath a tree, some of whose branches are dead while others are in full foliage (possibly a reference to Job 14:7–9). Job was viewed as an exemplar of patience and his suffering and humiliation as a prefiguration of Christ’s. His presence in the picture has been taken as the cue to its exegetical content. The three crosses of Calvary are seen on the hill at left; lower down on the slope is an abandoned shed and two shepherds, while through an opening can be seen people going about their business: contrasting images of death and life. Thus, as in The Met's painting, the viewer/worshipper encounters different sites for meditation as he or she explores the picture.Blass-Simmen (2006) has shown that in painting the two pictures Carpaccio resorted to a number of visual sources. It has long been recognized that the poses of the Maries and Saint John in the Berlin painting derive from an invention of Mantegna known through an engraving of the Entombment. Many of the animals in The Met'sMeditationand the tomb monuments in the Berlin painting depend from pattern books. The representation of Job in both pictures is very close, suggesting the use of a common model. Blass-Simmen proposes, hypothetically, that both pictures were painted for the Scuola di San Giobbe in Venice. Although there is no proof for this—and their seventeenth-century provenance from Ferrara might be thought to argue against it (Sgarbi 1994), both pictures adopt a similar meditative approach to devotional painting and are in this sense complementary, even if they turn out not to have been painted as pendants, in the strict sense.The Date:The approach Carpaccio adopts in these two very singular paintings has been compared to that of Giovanni Bellini, in hisSacred Allegoryin the Uffizi, Florence (Robertson 1968), and to the great painting ofSaint Francis in the Wilderness, now in the Frick Collection, New York. Although The Met's picture has been dated as early as the 1480s (Lauts 1962) and as late as about 1508 (Zeri and Gardner 1973), in view of its conspicuous debt to Bellini, which extends to the richly descriptive style of the landscape, a date of ca. 1485–90 seems reasonable—five or ten years after that usually assigned to Bellini’sSaint Francis.Keith Christiansen 2014",

        "Intro Description": "This remarkable picture is a meditation on death and resurrection. Christ’s dead body is displayed on a broken throne inscribed in pseudo-Hebrew. A bird, a symbol of the soul, flies upward. The landscape—contrastingly barren and lush—alludes to the themes of death and life, as do the animals. The Old Testament prophet Job sits on a block inscribed in pseudo-Hebrew while opposite is Saint Jerome (ca. 347–420), who wrote a commentary on the book of Job. The turbaned figures in the background would have been familiar to Venetians through their trade with the Middle East and Egypt.",

        "Catalogue Entry": "Although he was a member of the Académie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture throughout his professional life, Chardin did not study at the Académie and had little if any traditional academic training in drawing from the model. He did not make preparatory studies for his canvases, upon which, according to contemporary reports, he worked slowly and with effort. His early still lifes include mostly inanimate objects: vegetables and fruit, dead game, hunting equipment, table- and kitchenware. It is therefore understandable that at first he was uncertain about painting the human figure, and even that he had to be teased into doing so by his friend, the portraitist Jacques Aved (1702–1766), as has been claimed.According to the dealer and collector Jean Pierre Mariette, writing some fifteen years after the fact, Chardin’s first figural picture showed a head of a young man blowing bubbles and was studied from a model. Eighteenth-century French taste for Dutch art of the seventeenth century, in which soap bubbles and other intimations of mortality abound, may have influenced Chardin’s choice, or he may have seen a painting by the Dutch artist Caspar Netscher (1639?–1684) of the same subject that reportedly belonged to Aved. However, assuming that the 1733 dates have been read correctly,Woman Sealing a Letter(Schloss Charlottenburg, Berlin) and perhapsThe Washerwoman(Nationalmuseum, Stockholm) are earlier. The servant in the Berlin picture seems to be a younger version of The Met's bubble blower. One of the small figures in the Stockholm picture is a little boy seated, full-length, and gazing with great concentration at a soap bubble.In 1739 Chardin exhibited a version ofSoap Bubblesat the Paris Salon, but which version? The answer is probably none of the three that have survived, in The Metropolitan Museum, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, and the National Gallery of Art in Washington. Two are horizontals, one, at the National Gallery, is a vertical, and there are slight differences among them. None is dated. The painting in Washington has been enlarged, while this one has been cut down. And although the Washington picture is an upright, it does not precisely match the engraving that Pierre Filloeul (1696–after 1754) surely made in 1739 after the exhibited work, which is assumed to have gone missing. The thick brushwork of the present canvas suggests that it is the earliest of the three that survive, and all may date to 1733 or 1734. It cannot be said for certain that The Metropolitan Museum painting originally had a pendant, even though it is likely, nor that it belonged until 1779 to Louis François Trouard, as the histories of ownership are difficult if not impossible to disentangle.Katharine Baetjer 2015",

        "Intro Description": "From a glass of soapy water, a young man blows a bubble, its iridescent, translucent surface caught in the sunlight. A child peers eagerly over the ledge without breaking the atmosphere of silent concentration. In earlier Northern European painting, this subject carried a moralizing message about the transience of life; however, Chardin’s canvas moves the register from the allegorical to the everyday. Chardin became famous for miraculous surface effects achieved through rough yet refined paint application, as seen in the central figure’s jacket, locks, forehead, and hands. He made copies of his most successful compositions: later versions of Soap Bubbles belong to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and to the National Gallery of Art, Washington. This painting was seized by the Nazis from Jane Mannheimer in Paris and illegally purchased for the Führer Museum in 1944. It was returned to France by the Service Français de la Récupération following an agreement with the Netherlands Art Property Foundation and was restituted in or after 1948.",

        "Catalogue Entry": "The sitter was the only daughter and heiress of Richard Milles, and married Lewis Thomas Watson of Lees Court, Kent, in 1785. Watson was descended collaterally from the Earls of Rockingham, and his mother had been a granddaughter of the second Duke of Rutland and a daughter of Henry Pelham, a former prime minister. The first of the couple's four sons was born in 1792, and in 1795 Lewis Watson succeeded his father as second Baron Sondes of Lees Court and of Rockingham Castle, Northamptonshire. He died in 1806. Three years later, Lady Sondes married Brigadier General Sir Henry Tucker Montresor. She died in Kent in 1818.Reynolds charged one hundred guineas, his standard price from 1782 on for a fifty-by-forty-inch half-length, for each of two portraits of Mrs. Watson. She sat for the artist seven times in March 1789 and twice in May. A fifty-guinea payment is recorded in March and another in July 1789. In May 1789 there was another payment in the same amount, for a “copy,” which was “paid by Mr. Milles,” and a like sum in July of that year under the heading “Mrs. Watson; given to Mr. Mills.” Watson or his father must have commissioned the first portrait. Before it was finished, a copy was ordered for or by the sitter’s father, Richard Milles, although it is unclear who paid for it. That the second picture was in great part if not entirely by Reynolds is indicated by the fact that he asked the same amount for it. Were it to have been painted by one of his assistants, the buyer would have been charged half, but even so, it should not be assumed that the draperies and the background in either picture were painted entirely by the artist himself. Reynolds sent the first version, presumed to be the work still at Rockingham Castle, to the Royal Academy in the latter half of May 1789. The present picture, having changed hands a number of times and having been acquired through the trade, is thought to be the second. This is probably—but not certainly—the case. Richard Milles’s painting reverted through his only daughter to her sons, the third and fourth Barons Sondes, who would have owned both versions, making it impossible to determine, other than on grounds of quality, if at all, which is which.[2010; adapted from Baetjer 2009]",

        "Frame": "The frame is from England and dates to about 1800 (see figs. 1–4 above). This late Carlo Maratta (1625–1713) style carved and gilded frame is made of pine and mitred at the corners. Retaining its original dimensions, though with an early regilding, the carved ornament symmetrically emerges from center points and is resolved at the four corners with acanthus leaves. A small cavetto rises to husks from crossed ribbon centers. Within the hollow, boldly carved acanthus leaf and shield ornament are applied. Upon a small step twisted ribbon on stick lie before the draped astragal top edge. A hollow at the sides falls back to a simple lotus carved back edge. This handsome frame pattern was frequently used by the artist.Timothy Newbery with Cynthia Moyer 2017; further information on this frame can be found in the Department of European Paintings files",

Reynolds charged his standard price of one hundred guineas for each, indicating that both were in great part if not entirely painted by him. The white muslin dress and black satin hat were the height of fashion.",

        "Catalogue Entry": "The Picture and Its Companion Panels:This panel showing Saints Matthew and Francis is from the right-hand portion of a highly important altarpiece that had at its center a Madonna and Child (fragmentary, 84.5 x 56.7 cm; Monte dei Paschi di Siena) and, on the left, a panel with Saints Catherine of Alexandria(?) and John the Baptist (also fragmentary, 104.5 x 44.5 cm; Museum of Fine Arts, Houston). The altarpiece would have been completed with a base (predella) showing narrative scenes, pinnacles, and supporting pilasters possibly decorated with small images of saints. Beyond the fact that the above panels are all from the same altarpiece, nothing certain can be said about its further reconstruction, its original destination, or precise date, though there has long existed a consensus that the panels must date from the 1430s.Reconstructing the Altarpiece:In his early monograph of 1937 and again in 1988, Pope-Hennessy proposed that the three panels in Houston-Siena-New York formed part of a Gothic altarpiece known to have decorated the chapel of the Fondi or Tondi family in the church of San Francesco, Siena. According to early sources, that altarpiece dated to 1436, was dedicated to Saint James, and showed the Madonna and saints in the main panels and had a predella with scenes of the Nativity, the Adoration of the Magi, and the Crucifixion separated by borders of fruit and flowers (see Bossio 1575, Chigi 1625–26, and Ugurgieri Azzolini 1649).  Pope-Hennessy thought that the apostle James could have been included as a pinnacle panel and he further conjectured that a fire recorded to have swept through the church in 1655 could explain the cut-down state of the panels in Houston and Siena. His view was contested by Brandi (1941)—the other major scholar writing about Giovanni di Paolo at the time. Brandi agreed that the Houston-Siena-New York panels belonged to a single altarpiece but rejected an association with the Fondi or Tondi chapel, for which he proposed a fragmentary panel of Saint James together with three predella panels showing the Presentation in the Temple, the Crucifixion, and the Flight into Egypt that, in fact, have borders with flowers (all in the Pinacoteca Nazionale, Siena). Although both Pope-Hennessy’s and Brandi’s proposals have found support, current opinion favors associating the three predella panels in Siena not with the Fondi or Tondi polyptych but with a much earlier altarpiece painted in 1427, the main panel of which is in the Norton Simon Museum, Pasadena (see, for example, De Marchi 2012, p. 101). It should be pointed out that the redating of the predella panels in Siena to an earlier moment is part of a general reconsideration of Giovanni di Paolo’s chronology.A further step toward reconstructing the Houston-Siena-New York altarpiece was made by De Marchi (1992), who proposed identifying the predella with a series of panels showing the Annunciation (painted surface 38.7 x 44.7 cm; National Gallery of Art, Washington), the Nativity (38.7 x 44.3 cm; Pinacoteca Vaticana), the Crucifixion (39 x 53.8 cm; Gemäldegalerie, Berlin), the Adoration of the Magi (39.3 x 44.2 cm; Cleveland Museum of Art), and the Presentation of Christ in the Temple (The Met,41.100.4). This reconstruction required redating the series of predella panels, which had previously been dated by most scholars to the 1440s. De Marchi’s reconstruction was followed by Boskovits (2003) and Sallay (2010), whose detailed reconstruction is adopted here (see images above, fig. 1). Notable to Sallay’s reconstruction is the inclusion of a grille or tabernacle below the fragmentary panel of the Madonna and Child. This came from the realization that the composition of what was once a Madonna of Humility, seated on the ground, could not be imagined as filling the requisite space and that there must have been another element to the altarpiece. There are analogies for this, though they are rare. The tabernacle would have been for the Eucharist, while a grille could have been for viewing a relic or, alternatively, for cloistered nuns to receive communion, imagining the altarpiece placed up against a dividing wall  or screen. This reconstruction has been accepted by De Marchi (2012) and Zappasodi (2014). Initially, De Marchi considered identifying the reconstructed altarpiece with that mentioned by sources in the Fondi (or Tondi) chapel in San Francesco. Boskovits had left the matter open, but Sallay has argued persuasively against the identification and has further noted that the altarpiece need not have come from a Franciscan church, despite the presence of Saint Francis.Regardless of its original destination, this must have been one of Giovanni di Paolo's most impressive altarpieces. The two saints in The Met's panel are modeled in a way that emphasizes formal structure, and the haloes are notable for the attempt at foreshortening, with the classical lettering increasing in size in accordance with the projection of the halo. The Madonna and Child composition in Siena derives from Gentile da Fabriano's Quaratesi Altarpiece (Galleria degli Uffizi, Florence), and three of the predella scenes are based on the predella of Gentile'sAdoration of the Magi(Uffizi, Florence). Giovanni must have made a trip to Florence around 1430 and recorded compositions that particularly impressed him in an album.Keith Christiansen 2014; revised 2018",

        "Intro Description": "The moody, unfiltered emotions of Saints Matthew and Francis showcase Giovanni’s interest in depicting strongly expressive figures. The artist found inspiration for his implacable saints in the sculpture of his great compatriot Jacopo della Quercia. These two figures are from a major altarpiece. A scene from the base (predella) is also in the Museum and shows the presentation in the temple. Giovanni’s experimentation with foreshortening can be seen here in the lettering on the haloes, which changes size in accordance with the tilt of the figures’ heads.

        "Intro Description": "Monet visited Venice for the first time in autumn 1908. Captivated by the \"unique light,\" he embarked on a painting campaign featuring four different areas of the cityscape. He began each day with views such as this one, showing the airy façade of the Doge’s Palace from across the water on the islet of San Giorgio Maggiore. Monet departed Venice reluctantly, writing \"It's so beautiful … I console myself with the thought of returning next year, for I was only able to make attempts, beginnings.\" Although he never returned, Monet continued working on his canvases. The present picture and twenty-eight others were exhibited to acclaim in Paris in the spring of 1912.",

        "Catalogue Entry": "Jacques Louis David was a leading figure in the revolution and later became first painter to the Emperor. Following the Bourbon restoration of 1815, however, David was forced into exile in Belgium, where he painted a series of portraits of French émigrés who had decamped to the Belgian capital. In fact, the majority of David’s commissions during this period came from French expatriates who were former members of the revolutionary movement or political allies of Napoleon.One of David’s first portrait commissions in Brussels came from General Étienne-Maurice Gérard, a high-ranking commander in Napoleon’s army. After the defeat of theGrande Arméeat the hands of the British and Prussians, Gérard settled temporarily in Belgium. This depiction of Gérard by David was therefore the collaborative effort of two French exiles who, in the years following Napoleon’s downfall, were devoid of political power and at the nadirs of their respective careers. Gérard, however, did not dwell on the reversals he had recently suffered.David’s portrait successfully expresses the feeling of confidence the commander maintained during this trying period in his life. With its bright, vivid colors, the likeness conveys a sense of documentary realism. The brilliant light gives a splendid sheen to the surfaces of fabrics and stones alike, with the result that the image’s various recessed spaces appear flattened. Otherwise, this is a conventional military portrait. Gérard wears his field service \"undress\" and riding boots with spurs. A middle-aged man, he holds an opened letter in one hand and grips the corner of his enormous bicorne in the other. He stands on a multicolored, checkerboard pavement, and an inscription on the post of the balustrade provides the artist’s name as well as the location and date of the portrait’s creation. A crimson brocade curtain hangs behind the general, and beyond the balcony, an Italianate landscape dotted with trees and towers stretches into the distance.The honors Gérard received from kings and emperors are also on display, as his uniform is bedecked with military insignias, including the star and grand cordon of theLégion d’honneur. Additionally, the epaulettes on his jacket indicate that he was agénéral de divisionin the imperial army. Gérard is thus presented as a man of action who is worthy of holding other powerful positions and garnering future accolades. And the patron’s optimism about the future was not unwarranted: he would go on to revive his military and political careers, later returning to his native country to become minister of war, a marshal, and a senator.[Charles Howard 2012]",

The order was suppressed by Louis XVIII in 1815.); 4. above right, plaque of the grand-croix of the Légion d'honneur; 5. lower right, plaque of commandeur grand-croix of the Swedish Order of the Sword, conferred on July 29, 1814.Under his jacket is the grand cordon of the grand-croix of the Légion d'honneur. Gérard is in field service undress, without any embroidery on his jacket. The white feathers on his hat indicate a commanding officer of an army corps.",
        "Intro Description": "David’s role in the French Revolution and service to Napoleon forced the artist to go into exile in Brussels following the emperor’s defeat at Waterloo in 1815. This portrait, one of the first that he painted of the city’s émigré, imperial aristocracy, represents General Gérard, a highly decorated commander of the French army during both the Revolutionary and Napoleonic regimes. David seems to make no concession to the changed political climate in this portrait, which is among his most resplendent and commanding, recording Gérard with a strikingly vibrant palette and sharp realism.",

        "Catalogue Entry": "This well-preserved and haunting picture is a mature work by the greatest German artist of the Renaissance. The subject, referred to in German asAnna selbdritt(literally \"Anne in a group of three\"), gained widespread popularity in the second half of the fifteenth century due to the flourishing cult of Saint Anne, the mother of the Virgin Mary. This painting departs from the traditional formulas, in which Anne is shown seated, supporting the Christ Child on one knee and the Virgin Mary on the other, or, if standing, holding them in her arms. Dürer has placed Anne higher in the picture field, and the breadth of her headdress gives her a certain monumentality, but all the figures are depicted in natural proportion. By cropping them to half length and bust length, Dürer obviates compositional problems commonly associated withAnna selbdrittgroups.In most representations ofAnna selbdrittChrist holds a symbol such as an apple (Christ’s atonement for original sin) or grapes (Eucharistic wine/Christ’s blood). The motif of the sleeping infant, foreshadowing his death, was probably inspired by the work of Giovanni Bellini, which Dürer knew from his trips to Venice. The blue tones in the shadows of the infant’s face create a pallor which emphasizes the allusion to death. Anne’s hand on her daughter's shoulder takes on a consolatory meaning, and her distant gaze suggests a premonition of Christ's Passion. By these means Dürer has greatly enhanced the meditational effectiveness of the image.The picture was probably commissioned by the Nuremberg patrician Leonhard Tucher (1487–1568), and it remained with the Tucher family until 1628. In 1630, the great Dürer collector Maximilian I, elector of Bavaria, purchased the painting as part of a sustained acquisition campaign that brought numerous important works by Dürer to Munich. Yet this happened only after he had rejected the work as a copy upon initial inspection in 1628, and even the entry in the 1630 inventory of the electoralKammergaleriecontains a remark doubting whether the work was entirely by Dürer's hand. The painting remained in the electoral, then royal, Bavarian collections until 1852, when, apparently demoted to the status of a copy, it was included in a substantial sale of paintings from Schloss Schleißheim and bought by the sculptor and collector Joseph Otto Entres.Shown in Munich in 1854, after it had been cleaned, it was hailed in the press as a sensational rediscovery. However, one laudatory article in theDeutsches Kunstblattby the art historian Ernst Förster prompted a vehement rebuttal by Gustav Friedrich Waagen (1854), director of the Gemäldegalerie, Berlin, who firmly rejected Dürer’s authorship. The attribution issues were complicated by the known existence of several copies of this composition, one of which also had been included in the 1852 Schleißheim sale. The dispute between Waagen and Förster, carried out in subsequent issues of theKunstblatt, long remained the definitive record of the work, which, after its 1867 sale by Entres, spent the next several decades in the collection of Ivan Kuris in Odessa, less accessible to Dürer scholarship.A renewed assessment began upon the painting’s appearance in Dresden, where Ivan Kuris’s widow brought it about 1909. Max J. Friedländer offered his full endorsement of authenticity to the dealer Joseph Duveen, who took the painting to the United States in 1911. For many decades to follow, Dürer’s authorship was unanimously accepted, until 2002, when Claus Grimm maintained on formal and technical grounds that the painting is an accomplished workshop production based on preparatory drawings by Dürer.However, The Met's work is entirely typical of Dürer’s style and technique in the years around 1520. Contrary to previous statements in the literature, is also very well preserved. Saint Anne’s eyes show Dürer’s typical placement of catchlights opposite a minute, crisp reflection along the inner rim of the iris. Also, the shadows of Anne’s headdress and Mary’s dress were worked up with the heel or side of the painter’s hand—a modeling technique that has been observed on other works by Dürer. Numerous close correspondences in style, motifs, and technique to contemporary paintings, drawings, and prints by the artist make an attribution to Dürer himself all but certain. However, recent technical examination suggests that the date and monogram on the picture were added later. Nevertheless, a date of 1519 was documented by the time of Elector Maximilian’s acquisition in 1630. There is also a surviving study by Dürer—a brush drawing of Saint Anne on gray prepared paper, for which the artist's wife, Agnes, sat as the model—signed and dated 1519 (Albertina, Vienna). Similarities to this and numerous works dating around that time indicate that The Met's picture dates from that year.[2012; adapted from Waterman in Ainsworth and Waterman 2013]",
        "Technical Notes": "The support is a linden panel with the grain oriented horizontally. Past intervention makes it impossible to discern the number of boards that compose the panel. There are several splits in the support along the wood grain in the middle third of the panel. At some point prior to entering the collection, the panel was thinned to approximately .5 centimeters and attached to a support composed of a walnut veneer and a three-layer plywood sheet; mahogany strips were attached to the perimeter of the whole composite. A mahogany cradle probably dating to the early twentieth century is attached to the verso.Abarbealong all four edges indicates that the composition retains its original dimensions and that an engaged frame was in place when the white ground preparation was applied. Along the very edge of the perimeter, there are fragments of linear indentations, which may be the remnants of an original score line along the border between the paint surface and a frame. Wide beveling in the surface plane along the entire perimeter may have been imposed when the preparation layers were pared down to sharpen the division between the pane and the engaged frame.The painting is signed with an ad monogram set beneath the date \"1519.\" Although a similar double-stroke style of monogram is seen in other paintings associated with Dürer, neither the monogram nor the date can be original because the finely divided pigments used are characteristic of a post-1850 industrial manufacturing process.The paint layers are generally in good condition. A few tiny paint losses are scattered throughout. Residues of a dark toning layer, removed in the nineteenth century after the painting left the royal Bavarian collection at Schleißheim, can be seen under high magnification. They manifest as minute, round, brown black deposits lodged in and along the craquelure. With the exception of a few strokes concealing slight abrasion in the child’s flesh, restoration is limited to the small losses and the abrasion in the background.The paint layers were built up using small strokes that feather the colors into each other and often follow the form of the object depicted. This is especially noticeable in the shadows on the faces. In the shadows of Saint Anne’s drapery the glazes were applied with the side of a hand, and similar marks can be seen in the red lake glazes on Mary’s dress. Many bright red fibers are present in the passages containing red lake because the pigment was manufactured from red-dyed wool or silk cloth. The background has a brownish cast that is possibly due to a degradation commonly seen in paint layers composed of copper-containing green pigments. It is likely that the background was originally a more brilliant, saturated green. Infrared reflectography revealed a few faint contour lines of underdrawing in the hands. They were apparently done with a dry material and are positioned slightly differently from the final painted forms.[2013; adapted from German Paintings catalogue]",

        "Intro Description": "Dürer traveled to Italy from 1505–7, in particular to Venice, where he drew many inspirations for his art. Venetian painting encouraged Dürer’s interest in rich color and meticulous attention to detail, as well as simplicity of form. Dürer’s haunting devotional painting depicts Saint Anne, the Virgin Mary’s mother, who was particularly venerated in Germany, with the Virgin and Child. Anne’s hand on her daughter’s shoulder takes on a consolatory meaning, and her distant gaze suggests a premonition of Christ’s Passion. Although this panel’s date and monogram were added later, the date is likely accurate.",

        "Catalogue Entry": "The vogue for eye miniatures took hold during the early years of the nineteenth century. It is supposed to have originated in the days of the French Revolution and to have had erotic and political significance. In 1786 Richard Cosway (62.49,24.80.499) painted Mrs. Fitzherbert's eye for the Prince of Wales, later George IV (Stephen Lloyd,Richard and Maria Cosway, exh. cat., Edinburgh, 1995, p. 118, no. 60, colorpl. 54). George Engleheart (38.146.16,26.168.14,11.218) first recorded making a miniature of an eye for a lady in 1796 (G. C. Williamson, \"Miniature Paintings of Eyes,\"Connoisseur10 [1904], pp. 147–49), and William Wood (95.14.95,95.14.97) painted the eye of Mrs. Oliphant in 1806 (no. 6148 in his ledger). William Pether (68.213) is known to have made some signed eye miniatures (e.g., no. P.154-1931 in the Victoria and Albert Museum). Although the names of other eminent miniaturists are frequently attached to the British examples, they are usually by lesser hands.[2016; adapted from Reynolds and Baetjer 1996]",

        "Catalogue Entry": "The Artist:Alessandro Turchi, also known as l’Orbetto, began his career in Verona, where he established a monumental figure style executed increasingly with softly modeled brushwork. During this early period, Turchi painted works for Verona’s Accademia Filarmonica and Goldsmiths’ Guild. He studied in Venice around 1615, and then settled in Rome. After working successfully alongside Giovanni Lanfranco (1582–1647) and Carlo Saraceni (1579–1620) in the Quirinal Palace in 1616, Turchi enjoyed a prestigious Roman career, painting for some of the period’s most prestigious patrons, including the Giusti and Borghese families. In 1637, Cardinal Francesco Barberini (1597–1679) sponsored Turchi’s position as Principe, or director, of Rome’s Accademia di San Luca.The Painting:The Judgment of Parisis a mature, Roman work characterized by Turchi’s monumental, classicized figures presented in a frieze-like arrangement softened by carefully blended brushwork, particularly in the modeling of the flesh and draperies. At left, Hermes and Paris consider the beauty of Aphrodite, Hera, and Athena, whose interlaced figures offer the viewer three angles of the nude female body. The head of Medusa found on Athena’s shield brackets the gazes aimed at the women, but also hints at the goddess’s own might. A sleeping dog and three goats, indicative of the Arcadian setting, lead the eye into an otherwise little developed landscape background; Hera’s attribute, the peacock, appears at her feet.The format and composition, including tight cropping and the figures’ sculptural stasis even as they gesture to one another, are closely comparable to a group of four mythological subjects from the late 1630s painted for Turchi’s important Veronese patron, Gaspare Gherardini. That group, described in 1718 by Bartolomeo Dal Pazzo, included aJudgment of Paristhat has not survived but is known through an etching by Gaetano Zancon (1771–1816).[1] The figure of Hera in The Met’s painting is also comparable to the figure representing Diana in Turchi’sBacchus and Ariadne(Hermitage Museum, St. Petersburg), generally dated to the mid-1630s. Daniella Scaglietti Kelescian dates The Met’s painting to the late 1630s based on comparison with Turchi’sCleopatra’s Suicide(private collection) andDeath of Marcantonio and Cleopatra(Musée du Louvre, Paris), both of which exhibit an even greater interest in a softly modeled paint surface.[2] The latter was Turchi’s contribution to a prestigious commission for the Parisian hôtel by Louis Phélypeaux de la Vrillière (1599–1681) in which leading artists, including Guido Reni (1575–1642), Nicolas Poussin (1594–1665), Pietro da Cortona (1596–1669), and Saraceni were assigned antiquarian themes.Turchi painted the subject ofThe Judgment of Paristhroughout his career, often with loose reference to Marcantonio Raimondi’s celebrated engraving after Raphael (19.74.1). The scale and materials of at least three of Turchi’s versions, including an oil on slate (private collection) and two oils on copper (lost and Gemäldegalerie, Kassel), indicate their popularity for collectors cabinets.[3] Early in his Roman career, Turchi painted a large oil on canvas of the subject (Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister, Dresden) that was destroyed during World War II.[4] A drawing attributed to Turchi (Galleria Este, Modena) may have been the one of the “quattro dissegni per li suoi quadri” presented for approval to Gherardini for his very large, oil on canvas version in the late 1630s.[5]David Pullins 2020[1] Scaglietti Kelescian 2019, pp. 293–96, no. 167.

        "Notes": "When this picture was illustrated by Fröhlich-Bum in 1923, the panel had been slightly cut at the top and the three small figures of the Graces painted out. At some point after this the original figures of the Graces were uncovered, and a strip of 3 1/2 inches was added to the top of the panel; the head of the central Grace is thus a recent invention (see Sterling 1955).",
        "Intro Description": "This painting appears to depict the birth of Cupid, with attendants ministering to his mother, Venus. The lively, decorative composition is typical of French artists working in the style developed by the Italians at the château de Fontainebleau, such as Rosso Fiorentino of Florence and Primaticcio and Niccolo dell Abate of Bologna. The frame is sixteenth-century Italian.",

        "Catalogue Entry": "Bol was a highly successful artist in Amsterdam, but like several slightly later pupils and followers of Rembrandt he came from the South Holland city of Dordrecht. His teacher there is not named in documents, but Jacob Gerritsz Cuyp (1594–1651/52), father of Aelbert Cuyp (1620–1691) and the most prominent painter in Dordrecht at the time, is a likely candidate. Bol probably went to study with Rembrandt in Amsterdam in about 1636, and he appears to have remained with him until about 1641. Like Rembrandt, Bol specialized in portraits and history pictures.Petronella Elias, identified by Ekkart in 2002, was the daughter of Joost Pietersz Elias (1622–1694), a merchant, and his first wife, Rebecca Spiegel (1626–1651), who was a first cousin of Bol's wife, Elisabeth Dell. Petronella married her mother's cousin (and Bol's brother-in-law), Gerard Elbertsz Dell (1644–1688), in May 1666, and died eight months later. Although the sitter's father long outlived his daughter and her mother, the portrait descended in the latter's family, and may have been commissioned by Petronella's maternal grandfather, Elbert Spiegel (1600–1674), or her aunt Elisabeth Spiegel (1628–1707), the eldest of her mother's four sisters.This work is similar in composition to three portraits in a series of five, commissioned by Elbert Spiegel from Amsterdam painter Dirck Santvoort, representing Elbert's daughters with attributes of the Five Senses. It is especially close to the portrait of Petronella's mother (private collection), also depicted with fruit, in the role of Taste. In Petronella's portrait, however, the motif of fruit—common in Dutch portraits of children—was likely intended to suggest that she is the product of a fruitful marriage.Raimond Slicher (1752–1807), son of Wigbold Slicher and probable compiler of his father's inventory (1783), was an amateur artist who made small pastel copies of this work (1781; private collection) and other Slicher family portraits.The painting was engraved by Edward Smith (see Cunningham 1834).[2010; adapted from Liedtke 2007]",

        "Catalogue Entry": "The Artist: For a biography of Salvator Rosa, see the Catalogue Entry forSelf-Portrait(21.105).The Picture: The legendary founder of Rome, Aeneas, is shown in armor, asleep on the banks of the Tiber, his head resting on a rock, his sword and helmet laid beside him. Bending over him is the personification of the Tiber River, his hair shown as grassy reeds, his head seen against the clouds of a moonlit sky.Literary and Visual Sources: In Book VIII of Virgil’sAeneid(lines 26-65), the Trojan hero Aeneas has landed in Latium, exhausted from the brewing hostilities with the local Rutili and their leader Turnus. “This way and that he turns his anxious mind; / thinks, and rejects the counsel he design’d; / explores himself in vain, in ev’ry part, / and gives no rest to his distracted heart.” Aeneas finally finds nocturnal repose on the banks of the Tiber, when “thro’ the shadows of the poplar wood, / arose the father of the Roman flood; / an azure robe was o’er his body spread / a wreath of shady reeds adorn’d his head.” Tiberinus, the river god himself, tells Aeneas not to fear, for “when thirty rolling years have run their race, / thy son Ascanius, on this empty space, / shall build a royal town, of lasting fame”—a prophecy of the foundation of Rome.Rosa’s grand picture is closely aligned with Virgil’s text, and uses the rhetorical gesture of Tiberinus’s right arm that points toward Rome to depict the climax of his revelation. The river god’s floating gray drapery and head full of slippery reeds, paired with the lyrical setting of a nocturnal river bank, allude to the Seicento interest in painting as mute poetry. Rosa achieved the mysterious, lunar atmosphere through silvery-hued browns and beiges, punctuated with muted green and azure, which serve to evoke the haze of dreams and the watery world of the river god. As Helen Langdon has observed, Rosa’s Ovidian works imagined a “dark and dangerous” ancient world, and it is clear that his treatment of Virgil’s subject is no different.Aeneas’s pose was clearly important to Rosa, as the majority of the extant preparatory drawings show Rosa searching for the best angle for the legs and positioning of hands.[1] This exploration, characteristic of Rosa’s creative process, results in a final pose that accentuates the still-armored hero’s collapse under the weight of physical and emotional strain. Caterina Volpi (2014) has noted that Rosa depicted similarly slumped characters in theDrunkenness of Noah(private collection) andJacob and the Angel(Devonshire collection, Chatsworth), though the contorted nature of those bodies is so extreme that they more obviously expose Rosa’s weakness in convincingly portraying human anatomy. Volpi has also suggested that the figure of Aeneas can be traced to the pose of Endymion in Annibale Carracci’s fresco,Diana and Endymion(Palazzo Farnese, Rome), through theDiana and Endymion(Capitoline Museums, Rome) of Rosa’s contemporary, Pier Francesco Mola.Rosa’s picture also directly appealed to Pamphilij arts patronage of the 1650s, particularly Pietro da Cortona’s frescos of theAeneidin the Palazzo Pamphilj in Piazza Navona and Bernini’sFour Rivers Fountainerected in front of the family palace, both commissioned by Pope Innocent X. The shimmering effect of Rosa’s picture, generated by areas of impasto that catch light like water and brushstrokes that create slick glimmers that bounce off Aeneas’s armor, seems to mimic the splashes of Bernini’s pool. And as Volpi has noted, the figure of Tiberinus, with his strong, seated twisting body can be traced to the detail ofAeneas Arriving on the Shores of Italy, where Cortona’s river god has a similarly hoary beard, head full of reeds, and powerful torso. Likewise, Jonathan Scott (1995) suggested that Tiberinus is possibly derived from Giambologna’s colossalAppenino(reproduced in Stefano della Bella’s etching,2012.136.537.6). Rosa shifts the dynamism of these sources, however, to craft a less imposing Tiberinus, indicating a meeting between equals: the Roman river god and the hero who would found the city and empire before him.The Date: The painting’s verticality, restricted palette, and bold sculptural figures pressed against the picture plane are all characteristic of Rosa’s mature career of the 1660s. With much of his subject matter, even when based on popular sources, he still chose to depict narrative moments that had little or no visual tradition. While Aeneas’s dream was not commonly depicted in paintings before Rosa, there were examples of the scene from illustrated editions of theAeneid, such as Pierre Lombart’s engraving after Francis Cleyn (in the 1658 Latin edition of John Ogilby’sPublii Virgilii Maronis Opera). Even the densely illustratedAeneidcycle in the Palazzo Pamphilj did not contain a scene of the dream prophecy. As always, Rosa strove to paint subjects that, in his own words, “no one’s brush had touched before.”For such a large and commanding picture,The Dream of Aeneasis surprisingly absent from seventeenth-century sources. Xavier Salomon (2010) has suggested that the erudite subject matter and large scale indicate that it was made for public exhibition in Rome in the 1660s. Rosa frequently participated in these annual exhibitions, particularly those at San Giovanni Decollato and the Pantheon, which were a suitable system for Rosa’s desire to maintain control over the inspiration and design of his pictures. The subject was in line with the seventeenth-century reinvigorated interest in Golden Age Roman poetry, as well as the scientific and esoteric interests of Athanasius Kircher, who was working on his edition ofLatiumin the late 1650s (see Volpi 2014).The first reference to the picture is from an 1818 exhibition in London of the paintings of George Gillows, in which the catalogue claimed that the eight works by Rosa (including theAeneas) had formerly been in the collection of Prince Pio di Savoia—a convincing claim, though difficult to prove without eighteenth-century documentation. The picture was then sold in 1832 to the 2nd Lord Northwick and remained at Northwick Park, Gloucestershire, until its acquisition by The Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1965.The Etching: Like several of his large pictures from the 1650s and 1660s, Rosa also produced an etched version ofThe Dream of Aeneas(17.50.17-85). In the etching, the sleeping Trojan hero has propped himself with interlocked hands atop a shield (rather than resting on a rock) with a more heavily wooded background and more visible jar from which the Tiber allegorically flows under Tiberinus.The question of whether the painting or the etching came first has long puzzled scholars. Following Richard Wallace, scholars generally agree that the print dates to about 1662–63, after the painting. However, in a letter to his friend Giovanni Battistia Ricciardi on October 21, 1663, Rosa explained why he had added the word \"pinx\" (for \"pinxit\") on his etchings: \"Per sodisfarvi circa a quell Pinx delle mie carte, ce l'ho messo per mia cortesia e per far credere ch'io intanto l'ho intagliate, in quanto l'havevole dipinte. Ma la verità è che dall'Attilio in poi, tra le grandi, del Democrito e Dioggene della scodella, fra le mezzane, nessun'altra è stata da me collorita\" (In order to satisfy you concerning that “pinx” of my prints, I’ve written it there for my own sake and in order to suggest that I etched them because I painted them. But the truth is that, from theAtiliusonwards, and theDemocritusandDiogenes with the Bowlamong the medium-sized prints, I’ve not painted any of the other printed subjects.”[2] Rosa’s letter and stylistic similarities to works of the mid-1660s would suggest that the painting was likely executed between 1663 and 1665 (see Salerno 1963, Tomory 1971, Rotili 1974, Langdon 1980 and 2008, Scott 1995, Christiansen 2005, and Salomon 2010). However, Michael Kitson (1973) raised suspicions that either could have been executed first.At the heart of the debate is an ink and wash drawing (Musée du Louvre, Paris; 9741, see fig. 5 above) that depicts the full composition with Aeneas resting on a rock with several possible poses for Tiberinus’s gesturing arm. Following Prohaska (2008), Salomon (2010) read the drawing as closer to the painting, with the final position of Tiberinus’s arm extending outwards, and concludes that the drawing served as an intermediary design between the painting and therefore subsequent etching. The trouble with this linear logic, however, is that Rosa constantly revisited pictures, themes, and poses throughout his creative process, and none of his “final” sketches exactly correspond to their finished pictures. Unfortunately, Rosa was inconsistent in reversing the orientation of the etchings compared to their paintings (bothDemocritusandDiogeneswere reversed from their original orientation, but theAtiliuswas not), so the prints do not offer a solution.While a definitive conclusion may be difficult to ascertain, x-radiographs demonstrate that Rosa worked directly on the canvas, therefore with enough spontaneous confidence to work without an underdrawing. He still made slight adjustments to refine the composition, particularly the river god’s hair, which was originally wilder, as it appears in the etching. Rosa subsequently covered the darker olive fronds with the background to make the reeds more naturalistically fall around his face, a change that strengthens the argument that the painting was done after the etching. This kind of editing, clarifying the etching into the picture—also seen in the way that Rosa pares down the background and removes the shield—helps bring the psychological focus of the picture into the dream world of its majestic characters.Hannah Segrave 2019[1] See Mahoney 1977, group 74.[2] Hoare,The Letters of Salvator Rosa, London, 2018, pp. 634–35. The three paintings Rosa refers to areThe Death of Atilius Regulus(ca. 1652, Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, Richmond),Democritus in Meditation(1650–51, Statens Museum for Kunst, Copenhagen), andDiogenes Throwing Away His Bowl(1651–52, Statens Museum for Kunst).",

        "Intro Description": "Armored and elegant, the legendary founder of Rome, Aeneas, sleeps beside a theatrical, reed-laden personification of the city’s Tiber River. The subject comes from the ancient poet Virgil’s Aeneid, which was popularized in mid-seventeenth-century Rome through commissions by Pope Innocent X, including Bernini’s Four Rivers Fountain and frescoes in the papal family’s palace. Rosa may have painted this example specifically for public exhibition. The figures relate to the rough bandit types for which Rosa was famed, but the pared-down composition and their scale lend them a sculptural majesty. The complicated poses, heavy impasto of the armor, and loose brushwork of the river reeds enliven a static subject.",

        "Catalogue Entry": "Plimer was the son of a clockmaker who worked at Wellington, Shropshire. He is said to have run away from home with his brother Nathaniel and roamed about for two years. He is also said to have become a servant to Richard Cosway (see62.49) in 1781, learning in due course the art of miniature painting. He set up on his own and had considerable success, exhibiting from 1786 until 1830. His brother Nathaniel also practiced as a miniaturist. Andrew Plimer died in Brighton.Inside the case is a folded laid paper inscribedElizabeth Bushby / 1804 / by Plimer. This is a good example of Andrew Plimer's work, which is seen in considerable strength in the Huntington Library, Art Collections, and Botanical Gardens, San Marino, California. In Collis Huntington's catalogue (1897) the sitter was described as Jane Elizabeth Liddell, the daughter of Thomas, Lord Ravensworth, who married in 1823 William Keppel, sixth viscount Barrington. However, the recently discovered identification as a portrait of Elizabeth Bushby in 1804 is doubtless to be accepted. George C. Williamson (Andrew and Nathaniel Plimer: Miniature Painters, London, 1903, p. 46, ill. following p. 90) lists a portrait of Martha Bushby by Andrew Plimer from the collection of Arthur Jaffé, Hamburg.

        "Catalogue Entry": "The Artist:Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger was the most important member of an Anglo-Flemish artistic family that had a major impact on English painting at the end of the sixteenth century. Born in Bruges, he came to England in 1568 as a small child in the company of his father, Marcus the Elder, seeking religious freedom and a haven from the repressive Spanish occupation of the Low Countries. In London, father and son joined a large community of enterprising and educated Dutch-speaking refugees. Marcus the Younger likely trained under his father or another Netherlandish artist working in England. In 1595, he married Magdalen de Critz, whose brother John was himself a successful painter with Flemish origins. (Another brother-in-law was the celebrated miniaturist Isaac Oliver.)By the 1590s, Gheeraerts had established himself as a favored portraitist of the aristocracy; in particular, the patronage of Sir Henry Lee, the Queen’s Champion, introduced him to the culture of the court. Lee commissioned Gheeraerts’s most celebrated painting, the so-calledDitchley Portraitof Elizabeth I (National Portrait Gallery, London), in which the monarch appears standing atop a map of southern England. As in this work, many of Gheeraerts’s portraits combined poetic inscriptions with imagery drawn from court masques and spectacles. At the same time, his delicate rendering of men’s and women’s faces infused a new lyric sensitivity into English portraiture. Following the death of Elizabeth, Gheeraerts became a favored portraitist of Queen Anne, a sophisticated patron intimately linked with the court masque. By the 1620s, however, royal taste shifted to a new generation of Netherlandish painters, leaving Gheeraerts to seek out a more modest, frequently scholarly, clientele. Gheeraerts died in London at the age of seventy-four. His long and successful career bridged the achievement of Nicholas Hilliard with that of Anthony van Dyck and marked a major turning point in English portraiture.The Sitter:Ellen (Welsh: Elin) Maurice was an heiress claiming direct descent from the ancient princes of Wales. In the sixteenth century, the Welsh gentry, unlike their Irish counterparts, largely embraced the Protestant Reformation and the ascendance of the (originally Welsh) Tudor dynasty, seeing in the latter the fulfillment of bardic prophecies about the restoration of ancient, Celtic Britain. The sitter’s grandfather Sir William Maurice of Clenneny served in the House of Commons and is said to have coined the title \"King of Great Britain\" for his personal friend James I. Ellen Maurice’s first husband, John Owen, was a Welshman who amassed a fortune while serving as private secretary to Sir Francis Walsingham, the queen’s \"spymaster.\" Walsingham engaged Marcus Gheeraerts’s brother-in-law John de Critz as a courier in the 1580s, and it may have been through her husband’s employer that Ellen Maurice was introduced to the De Critz/Gheeraerts family of artists. While Welsh aristocrats continued to patronize traditional bardic poetry in their native tongue (a large archive of poetic manuscripts associated with the Maurice and Owen families survives at the National Library of Wales), their portraits expressed their assimilation to the fashions of the Elizabethan court, as exemplified by both Ellen Maurice’s attire and her choice of painter. At the time the portrait was painted, the sitter was roughly nineteen years old; the likeness may commemorate either her marriage or presentation at court.Following John Owen’s death in 1611, Ellen Maurice married Sir Francis Eure, a justice of the circuit court of North Wales. She died in 1626 and was buried at St. Mary’s Church in Selattyn (Shropshire), having devoted a portion of her wealth to the foundation of almshouses that survive to this day in Oswestry. Of her many children who survived to adulthood, her son and heir, Sir John Owen, became a noted soldier for the Royalist cause during the English Civil War. Her portrait remained in the possession of her direct descendants until its recent acquisition by The Met.The Portrait:The sitter appears in half-length, splendidly dressed in embroidered silk. Holding a richly decorated glove in one hand, she caresses a long strand of pearls in the other. Her long, stiff bodice, bulbous sleeves and wheel farthingale emulate the silhouette promoted by Queen Elizabeth in such images as Gheeraerts’sDitchley Portrait. As in that painting, an astonishing amount of pearls conveys the wealth of the sitter; her gesture of pinching one long strand between thumb and index finger enlivens the portrait and evokes the courtier’s refined movements. A starched standing ruff collar of transparent gauze and lace frames the sitter’s head and offsets the dark locks of hair that tumble down her cheeks. Typical for Gheeraerts’s depictions of women are the prominent eye sockets and vein visible in the sitter’s right temple, calling attention to her aristocratic pallor. Ellen Maurice’s pose, costume, and jewelry all closely resemble those in Gheeraerts’s 1600 portrait of Elizabeth Finch, Countess of Winchelsea (Earl of Radnor, Longford Castle), although Maurice’s youth and beauty distinguish her likeness within Gheeraerts’s oeuvre.Adam Eaker 2017",

        "Catalogue Entry": "Archibald Robertson was born at Monymusk, near Aberdeen, Scotland. After studying in Edinburgh and from 1786 in London, he worked again in Aberdeen. He went to the United States in 1791 and painted a miniature of George Washington which ensured his success. With his brother Alexander Robertson, also a miniature painter, he founded the Columbian Academy of Painting in New York. Andrew Robertson (see1986.390) was his younger brother. Sir Joshua Reynolds is said to have given him advice, and the miniature catalogued below is no doubt a product of Robertson's years in England or Scotland.Archibald Robertson’s miniature must date between 1786 and 1791. It is copied from the 1773 half-length self-portrait by Reynolds in the collection of Earl Spencer at Althorp. The artist's costume is accounted for by the fact that he was given an honorary Doctorate of Civil Law at the University of Oxford that same year. The Met owns a second miniature copy after Reynolds's self-portrait in the style of William Grimaldi (62.122.60).
