        "Catalogue Entry": "The miniature was received at The Met without an attribution. In 1965 E. G. Paine tentatively ascribed it to J. B. J. Augustin; in 1977 Richard Allen described it as of the school of Augustin, about 1800, and in the same year Edwin Boucher suggested that it might be by a Swiss painter, remarking that it resembled the work of François Ferrière (1752–1839). This miniature is an accomplished piece of about 1800–1810, showing the influence of both Isabey and Augustin in their republican and classical manners. It is perhaps not of sufficiently high quality to justify an attribution to Augustin.Augustin was born in Saint-Dié, near Nancy, where he studied with the painter Jean-Baptiste Charles Claudot (1733–1805) who also taught his younger rival Jean-Baptiste Isabey. He moved to Paris in 1781, where for the next twenty years he painted highly animated miniatures. His success was diminished by the more extensive patronage given by Napoleon I to Isabey. He was made chevalier of the Légion d'Honneur in 1821 and became painter-in-ordinary to Louis XVIII in 1824. He died of cholera in Paris.[2016; adapted from Reynolds and Baetjer 1996]",
        "Technical Notes": "The ivory, which is irregular in shape, was mounted on gesso-covered composition board before the miniature was painted. The model's dress, the tapestry on which she is working, and the table legs continue into the gessoed extension. The ivory is slightly cockled and has shrunk from side to side, exposing cracks through which the white gesso ground could be seen. It was determined that the original dimensions should be preserved and the frame modified to mask the cracks. A new glass was supplied, an additional painted molding was inserted into the frame, and the miniature was set between a new ragboard spacer and mount.[2016; adapted from Reynolds and Baetjer 1996]",

        "Notes": "Aivazovsky was a self-identified Armenian and a subject of the Russian Empire who resided largely in Crimea, which is now part of Ukraine, and who lived and worked on the Ukrainian mainland in 1854–56, during the Crimean War. His national identities are complex. The Department of European Paintings currently describes Aivazovsky as “Armenian, born Russian Empire [now Ukraine],” to reflect the multiple and intersecting nationalities identified in scholarship on the artist.On Aivazovsky’s national identities, see: Gianni Caffiero and Ivan Samarine,Light, Water, and Sky: The Paintings of Ivan Aivazovsky, London, 2012, pp. 20, 45–46; Shahen Khach'atryan,Айвазовский, известный и неизвестный / Aivazovsky, Well-known and Unknown, Samara, 2012, pp. 31–33, 36, 42–43; Grigory Goldovsky inIvan Aivazovsky: On the 200th Anniversary of the Artist's Birth, St. Petersburg, 2016, p. 10; Vazken Khatchig Davidian, “Image of an Atrocity: Ivan (Hovhannes) Aivazovsky’s Massacre of the Armenians in Trebizond 1895,”Etudes arméniennes contemporaines11 (2018), p. 47; and Andrey Kurkov et al.,Treasures of Ukraine: A Nation’s Cultural Heritage, London, 2022, p. 144.Aivazovsky signed his works in Armenian, Russian, and Latin script. The English transliteration of his Armenian name is Hovhannes Aivazian. The Russian form of his name is commonly transliterated into English as Ivan Aivazovsky, but multiple other spellings exist. The artist himself used Aivazovsky, Aivasovsky, and Aivasowsky.",
        "Intro Description": "Aivazovsky was a celebrated painter of seascapes. The artist’s affinity for the ocean began in his birthplace, the Black Sea port of Feodosia (Theodosia) in Crimea, then part of the Russian Empire and now in Ukraine. As a member of the city’s longstanding Armenian community, Aivazovsky had a rich cultural and linguistic background. He worked and exhibited widely, including in cities in Armenia, Georgia, Italy, Russia, Turkey, and mainland Ukraine. In 1892, he visited the United States. This miniature was presumably a gift to Isabel Hapgood, an author and a translator of French and Russian literature, during Aivazovsky’s trip to New York. Hapgood gave the miniature to The Met in 1913.",

        "Catalogue Entry": "This superb picture of about 1635 is the only finished landscape painting (as opposed to an oil sketch) by Rubens in an American collection. Almost all of the approximately three dozen known landscape paintings by Rubens, who made them largely for his own pleasure, have long been secure in British and Continental collections, many of them royal or princely.The present title goes back to the 1640 inventory of Rubens’s estate, where no. 108 is described as \"Un bois avec un chasse à l’aube de jour, sur fond de bois.\" However, when the panel was sold in the auction of the celebrated Lansdowne collection in 1806 its subject was said to be \"A Grand Landscape; scene, the Sun setting in fervid Heat, darting its fierce Rays from behind a Wood . . . it almost dazzles the eye to look at it.\" The connoisseur and collector Sir Abraham Hume noted in his copy of the sale catalogue that Sir Joshua Reynolds had once owned the picture, and that \"Sir W. W. Wynne\" was the successful bidder. Sir Watkin Williams-Wynn (1772–1840), 5th Baronet, and his descendants kept the landscape at their seat, Llangedwyn Hall in North Wales, until the death of the tenth baronet in 1987. After brief periods in the family estate and the art trade the picture—perhaps the last Rubens landscape available—was purchased by the Museum with the help of numerous funds and friends.The intensity and the red and yellow colors of the sunlight strongly suggest that the sun is setting; the deer, chased by a hunter and his hounds, are running for shelter in the deepening shadows of the forest. Rubens often suggested in his landscapes an encounter of elemental forces, such as light penetrating darkness, a struggle between life and death, or the cycle of growth and decay. Here the twisted forms of old trees contrast with the slender trunks of new ones and in their impetuous rhythms add to the sense of urgency and life surging throughout nature.Rubens’s later landscapes especially may be traced back to his Northern roots, such as the forest landscapes of about 1600 by Roelant Savery and Gillis van Coninxloo. In general he carried their ideas further, and modified them in ways reflecting Rubens’s esteem of Titian and Adam Elsheimer and his fresh experience of the Flemish countryside. (The painter’s country estate at Elewijt was purchased in 1635 and appears romantically transformed in works such asLandscape with the Chateau Het Steenin the National Gallery, London.)The panel is composed of ten pieces, in a configuration suggesting that a smaller support was expanded on all sides, especially at the top, left, and right. This probably occurred at an early moment in the course of work. Supports made in this impromptu manner usually occur in Rubens’s oeuvre when the object was intended for his own use.[2011; adapted from Liedtke 1992]",

        "Frame": "The frame is from France and dates to about 1640 (see figs. 1–4 above). This provincial Louis XIII frame is made of pine and constructed with mitred corners secured with tapered keys. The surface is an early water gilding applied to a dark red bole on a thick gesso layer with vigorous recutting. Not altered in size, the ornament is symmetrically laid out and emerges from center points. An acanthus and shield carved sight edge rises to a twisted ribbon before a hollow. The astragal top edge is carved in bunched leaves depicting laurel and berry, oak and acorn, jonquil and primrose, and has sunflower centers and acanthus corners. A half paterae pattern ornaments the back edge. This frame pattern is derived from early seventeenth-century Roman ornament. The frame was put on the painting after it entered the collection.Timothy Newbery with Cynthia Moyer 2017; further information on this frame can be found in the Department of European Paintings files",
        "Notes": "A small related picture which may be a preparatory sketch is owned by the Alte Pinakothek, Munich, and exhibited at Castle Schleissheim (inv. no. 48/3982). The Met's painting was engraved in reverse by Schelte a Bolswert as plate 17 in \"The Set of the Small Landscapes\" (Hollstein, no. 322; published in Eugène Duthuit,Manuel de l'amateur d'estampes, Paris, 1884, vol. 6, p. 254, no. 17). The landscape was apparently inspired by a composition by Roelant Savery or the engraving after it by Aegidius Sadeler (Hollstein, no. 232, published inRoelant Savery in Seiner Zeit, exh. cat., Wallraf-Richartz-Museum, Cologne, 1985, no. 122).",
        "Loan Restrictions": "This work may not be lent.",
        "Intro Description": "In 1635 Rubens acquired a manor known as Het Steen, whose landscape inspired many of the paintings he made for his own pleasure in the final years of his life. In this example, a thickly painted sun peeks through the branches at dawn, as a hunter (in the red coat) and his hounds chase deer in the forest. Hunting was a privilege reserved for aristocrats that aligned with Rubens’s new identity as lord of a manor, at a time in his life when he was able to make personal paintings that reflected his interests.",

        "Catalogue Entry": "The sitter, a young woman, is shown seated in an ivory-inlaid folding chair (also known as a Savonarola or Dante chair). She wears asottana(petticoat) with detachable sleeves—formerly an undergarment that became popular as an outer dress in the 1550s and ‘60s (see Orsi Landini and Niccoli 2005). This fashion provides a firm ground for dating the picture, both the date and attribution of which have long puzzled scholars (see References for the various opinions). The initial identity of the sitter as Maria de’ Medici (1540–1557), the daughter of Cosimo I de’ Medici and Eleonora of Toledo, has long since been abandoned, but without a further suggestion of who the young woman in question might be. Equally implausible was the idea that the picture might be by Bronzino, and over the years the names of various artists have been proposed, ranging from a major figure such as Francesco Salviati to (more plausibly) Michele di Ridolfo del Ghirlandaio (Michele Tosini, 1503–1577) or his pupil Francesco Brina (1540–1586)—by both of whom there are known portraits—to (impossibly) Lucia Anguissola (1536/38–before 1568), the sister of the famous female painter Sofonisba Anguissola. To date, the most detailed analysis of the picture is that of Alessandro Cecchi (2001), who has made a strong case for ascribing this picture to the very gifted young Jacopo Zucchi, working before he went to Rome and at a time when he was still strongly under the influence of Giorgio Vasari, with whom he had worked on the decoration of the Salone del Cinquecento in Palazzo Vecchio in Florence. Cecchi characterizes the picture as exemplifying a period when this artist “oscillates between a dependence on Vasarian models and the emergence of an increasingly preponderant style that is both independent and innovative and that would have its fruition in late Cinquecento Rome.” It should be noted that even before moving to Rome, where he achieved fame working for Cardinal Ferdinando de' Medici in his Palazzo Firenze (1574), Jacopo had participated in the decoration of the studiolo of Francesco de’ Medici in Palazzo Vecchio.Keith Christiansen 2018",

        "Notes": "Giuliano de' Medici was the son of Lorenzo the Magnificent and Clarice Orsini. During the exile of the Medici from Florence (1494–1512) he lived in Urbino, where he was a friend of Pietro Bembo, Baldassare Castiglione, and probably also of Raphael. In 1512 the Medici returned to Florence and Giuliano ruled as head of state for one year before relinquishing the position to his nephew Lorenzo. In 1513 Giuliano's brother Giovanni was elected Pope Leo X and Giuliano went to Rome where he was appointed Captain of the Church. In February 1515 he traveled to Turin to marry Philiberte of Savoy, the aunt of Francis I, King of France. In October/November 1515 Giuliano and Philiberte were named Duke and Duchess of Nemours. Giuliano's tomb in San Lorenzo, Florence, was sculpted by Michelangelo; it includes a statue of Giuliano above figures of Night and Day.From mentions by Pietro Bembo (in a letter of April 19, 1516; see Wanscher 1926) and Vasari (Le vite, 1568; Milanesi ed., 1879, vol. 4, pp. 352–53), we know that Raphael painted a portrait of Giuliano, which must date from either just before or just after Giuliano's trip to Turin. The original portrait is lost but a number of copies and variants survive. The closest version to that in The Met's is a painting in the Uffizi, Florence, which is attributed to Alessandro Allori; however, it omits the view of the Castel Sant' Angelo. Other versions are bust-length only: one in the collection of the Duke of Northumberland, Alnwick Castle, attributed to Giulio Romano; one formerly in the Zambrini di Vallescura collection, canton Ticino (sold, Sotheby's, Milan, June 12, 2001, no. 35); and a miniature by Bronzino in the Uffizi which depicts the sitter bare-headed. Vasari included a portrait of Giuliano based on this composition in a fresco in the Palazzo Vecchio, Florence. See Maffei 1959 and Langedijk 1983 for discussion and reproduction of the portraits of Giuliano.",
        "Intro Description": "This painting is an early copy of a portrait by Raphael of Giuliano de Medici, Pope Leo X's younger brother.  Giuliano sat for his portrait so that it could be sent to Philiberte of Savoy, the aunt of Francis I of France, to whom he had become engaged. As the couple had not yet met the portrait gave her an idea of his appearance. The match was a political one. Pope Leo was hoping to cement the alliance between the French and the papacy. Portraits were often included in the diplomatic arrangements of such dynastic marriages.",

        "Catalogue Entry": "In 1821 Rémond, a pupil of Jean Victor Bertin, won the second Prix de Rome in the category of historical landscape painting, enabling him to study for four years in Italy. In a series oftableautins(little paintings) that he painted there, he developed an approach to painting that combines sketching from nature and classical composition, of which this is a highly successful example. Owing to its loose brushwork,View of the Basilica of Constantine from the Palatine, Romegives every indication of having been painted out of doors, quickly and in a single sitting. The liquid appearance of the impasted paint perfectly conveys the fabric of Rome: limpid atmosphere, ubiquitous masonry, and unexpected lushness.Essentially all that remains of the fourth-century Basilica of Constantine are the three contiguous vaults of its south aisle, which are open to the Forum and the Palatine Hill, where Rémond positioned himself for this view. Rather than depict the basilica’s monumental shell in its entirety, however, he excised the rightmost vault from its larger context, leaving it virtually impossible to identify without specialized knowledge of the site. This fragment of a fragment, which fully occupies the lower left quadrant of the picture surface, is thus an unconventional foundation on which to build a composition.Rémond undoubtedly placed his easel where he did because the prospect offered not one vanishing point but two, which diverge: the first terminates in the vault at left, while the second continues into the open landscape at right, so that the symmetry of the composition is reinforced despite the difference in the respective depths of field. (The grassy foregound continues up the right edge, working together with the Basilica to formulate arepoussoirthat frames the right half of the view.) Moreover, as the approaching clouds stretch across the entire width of the picture, they further unify its lower half.Why employ such a complicated, downright Cartesian spatial construction in the service of a painting that is ostensibly a sketch? In fact Rémond made a cognate of this view, and it is possible that the second one is a replica that he painted in his studio as a cabinet picture intended for a collector. (The other is in a private collection, Paris; see Philip Conisbee,Painting from Nature: The Tradition of Open-Air Oil Sketching from the 17th to 19th Centuries, exh. cat., Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, 1980, p. 26, no. 33, ill. in color on front cover.) Its size notwithstanding, the painting exemplifies the artist’s ambition to satisfy a growing taste for such works.Asher Ethan Miller 2013",

        "Catalogue Entry": "The Painting:This previously unpublished painting is an academy (académiein French), so called because artists were traditionally trained to draw and then paint in art academies. These ranged from private ateliers, or studios, run by seasoned artists to the state-sponsored Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris.[1] A muscular nude male is posed in a three-quarters view from behind. He supports his lower body by resting his left knee on the seat of a padded stool, the dirty sole of his foot exposed, and with his right leg extended straight back, the foot flat on the studio floor. He balances himself by placing his left hand on a plinth and looks to the left. The light falls from the left, resulting in adjacent pools of bright and dark color. The paint is applied boldly and intuitively, and is especially vigorous in the treatment of the hair. Areas of brown underpaint were initially laid down over the white ground for areas of shadow and then left exposed selectively, for example, in the shaded whites of the eyes and buttocks. The figure is set against a loosely brushed background.Direct study of the human form—to both observe and record it—was fundamental to an artist’s training, and academies served a strictly pedagogical function. Although the figure in this academy is unaccessorized, however, the painting may reveal more about the aim of the exercise that brought it into being than merely capturing the features of the model. The canvas is a squarish rectangle; its length is slightly greater than its height. Nevertheless, the figure is essentially set within a virtual square (approximately 69 centimeters on each side), one divided diagonally by a line that runs from the model’s head to the heel of his right foot. The painting’s geometry compels the beholder to shift focus between the implied square in which the figure is inscribed and the actual rectangle of the canvas. This suggests that the painter’s efforts were enriched by a lesson in the animation of space.Typically, the names of studio models were not recorded by the artists who portrayed them, as is the case here. Models assumed poses dictated by their employers. The pose might be natural or it might approximate a work of Greek or Roman art—or more recent art emulating antique models. This figure recalls heroic nudes in classic works of art that students could study in public collections such as the Musée du Louvre or in reproduction, either as plaster casts or through engravings. The pose recorded in The Met’s study was likely inspired by two Roman sculptures. The emphatic diagonal pose recalls the marble figure known as theBorghese Gladiator, which was acquired by Napoleon in 1807 and displayed at the Louvre beginning in 1811. The disposition of the academy figure’s back, the way he supports himself with his right arm, and his fleecy head turned to the side were probably inspired by the Roman marble sculpture widely known as theDying Gladiator, in the Musei Capitolini, Rome.[2] Working from the live model, the painter would have been keenly aware of the authority wielded by these two prototypes, but he neglected none of the earthiness of the figure before him.Attribution to Courbet:The back of the canvas, which is unlined and on its original stretcher, is inscribed in red paint:A mon collègue et cher / ami Gilbert / G. Courbet(to my colleague and dear / friend Gilbert / G. Courbet). Another inscription, applied with a pen in now-faded brown ink, appears on the stretcher:BaronSteuben. (For the back of the painting, see fig. 1 above.) By December 1839, shortly after his arrival in Paris, Courbet was receiving instruction in the atelier of history painter baron Charles-Guillaume-Henri-Auguste-François-Louis de Steuben (1788–1856), whose address was 30 rue Hautefeuille, on the Left Bank of the Seine.[3] Steuben’s name may have been added to the stretcher by his supplier. Alternatively, it may have been added to distinguish this study from ones Courbet made nearby at the Académie Suisse, located at 4 quai des Orfèvres, on the Ile de la Cité, which the young artist began to frequent before concluding his tutelage under Steuben, in or after April 1840. The Académie Suisse was an informal and extremely liberal art school founded by a former painter and well-known artist’s model, François Martin Suisse (ca. 1781–1859).[4] There, in the early 1840s, Courbet began to encounter sympathetic young painters such as François Bonvin (1817–1888).Physical examination of the present work has yielded no evidence that would be inconsistent with an attribution to Courbet (see Technical Notes), yet gaps in the documentation of its early history remain. Thus, further study is required to confirm its role in Courbet’s origins as a painter. Apart from a few written accounts and a small corpus of accepted works, the fruits of Courbet’s first year or so in Paris have largely disappeared.[5] This painting is difficult to reconcile, at least on the basis of a photograph, with the painted academy in the Musée des Beaux-Arts, Reims, whose provenance, beginning with the artist’s youngest sister, Juliette Courbet (1831–1915), is unbroken.[6] Another example is theSelf-Portrait with Upraised Armrendered in graphite and chalks (The Met1975.1.589).Courbet’s Training in Paris, 1839–40:In October 1837, Courbet moved from his native Ornans to enroll at the Collège Royal de Besançon. He quit in 1838 in order to register at the Académie de Besançon, where he devoted himself full-time to learning art. Determined to become a painter, he moved to Paris in the fall of 1839. It is not known why Courbet chose Steuben as a teacher upon arrival in the capital. At a time when aspiring artists considered the attainment of a Prix de Rome to be an assured path to success, no pupil of Steuben’s appears on the competition rosters. Writing to his family from Paris on December 26, 1839, Courbet reported: “I still work with M. Steuben, who does not bother much with his students. All he does is appear every morning. He is satisfied with me. I am, I think, the best in his atelier. We are only three or four.”[7]In a letter to his family of April 1840, Courbet showed signs of moving on from Steuben: “I go to a life-model class at six o’clock every morning. Ever since the weather has been fine enough to paint outside, I have left my teacher temporarily, for the exhibition and the life class take up all my time, but I will go back. I don’t know whether I’ll return to M. Steuben. I think I’ll go to Picot’s.”[8] The life class may have been held at the Académie Suisse. As for François Edouard Picot (1786–1868), who had been awarded the Prix de Rome for history painting in 1813, he ran a popular atelier that, unlike Steuben’s, yielded many contestants for the prize.Courbet continued to mention making life studies in letters home. In one, written from Paris on January 25, 1841, he stated: “This is how my day is organized: in the morning at 8 A.M. I go to paint from the live model until 1 P.M. Only at 10 A.M. do I come back to eat a plate of soup the caretaker’s wife makes for me, for my hotel is next door to the academy.” Once again, it is probably the Académie Suisse to which Courbet refers.[9]Courbet and the Nude:Courbet gained renown by displaying scenes of country life in his native Franche-Comté region at the state-sponsored exhibition, the Salon, held annually in Paris. Many members of the public regarded Courbet’s unsentimentalized and unidealized treatments of everyday subjects on a grand scale to be provocatively coarse and vulgar. One such example, completed for the Salon of 1850–51, isA Burial at Ornans(1849–50, Musée d’Orsay, Paris); another isYoung Ladies of the Village, shown at the Salon of 1852 (The Met40.175). Over the course of his career, Courbet plumbed a range of subjects: landscape and seascape, hunting, still life, and portraiture—with a penchant for self-portraits. At least as important were paintings of women, singly and in pairs, physically self-possessed, frequently eroticized, and often unclothed, though lacking the requisite mythological or allegorical pretext generally required by tradition for representing the female nude.What Courbet painted only rarely, beyond his student work, was the male nude. A notable exception, or near-exception, isThe Wrestlers(fig. 2), a canvas depicting life-size figures that he exhibited at the Salon of 1853. Short of suggesting a direct connection toThe Wrestlers, The Met’s academy serves as a reminder that the male nude was not unprecedented in Courbet’s work. The athletic figure, or figures, seen from behind, which is the view enjoyed from the grandstands shown inThe Wrestlers, was something Courbet had painted as part of his training. In this work, Courbet’s adoption of poses derived from the seriesThe Labors of Hercules(1632, Museo Nacional del Prado, Madrid), by the Spanish painter Francisco de Zurbarán, who worked directly from the live model, is illuminating with respect to The Met’s academy.[10] As if to call additional attention to the rear view implied by the position of the spectators inThe Wrestlers, Courbet also exhibited a complementary painting at the 1853 Salon,The Bathers(fig. 3), in which one of the two women, who is more or less nude, is presented from the back.Ownership History:As noted above, the painting is inscribed with a dedication to “my colleague and dear friend Gilbert.” A clue to Gilbert’s identity is found in the estate stamp printed in black ink at the lower right corner of the painting and again on its stretcher: JULES GILBERT / 17, RUE DU DRAGON / PARIS. He appears to have been Jules-Julien Gilbert, about whom there is scant information. According to theAnnuaire de l’Association des Artistes Peintres, Sculpteurs, Architectes, Graveurs & Dessinateurs, published in Paris in 1907, Gilbert lived at that address and had been active as anartiste-peintresince at least 1881. The archives of the Association’s successor organization, the Fondation Taylor, confirm Gilbert’s year of death as 1909.[11] Gilbert was also a collector of Middle Eastern antiquities. In 1902, he sold two objects to the Louvre. In 1903, he disposed of his substantial holdings of this material at auction; the catalogue describes him as anartiste-peintrewho had gathered his holdings “pendant son long séjour en Orient où il professait la peinture” (during his lengthy sojourn in the Orient, where he taught painting).[12] Gilbert lived with a Mme Eugénie Gilbert, presumably his wife, who was also anartiste-peintre; she died in 1923. Their death records have not been located in the city archives, and it may be that the Gilberts used the proceeds of the sale to leave Paris.As of this writing, no documentation corroborating a relationship between Courbet and Gilbert has come to light. Was Gilbert one of the “three or four” students who worked alongside Courbet in Steuben’s atelier or at the Académie Suisse? If so, and assuming he was born about the same time as Courbet, he would have been approximately ninety years old if he died in 1909. That is not impossible, though it begs the question of whether there were two Gilberts—possibly father and son, both artists—who spanned the period from 1839, when Courbet became Steuben’s pupil; 1877, when Courbet died; to 1909, when Jules-Julien Gilbert died. Or was Courbet linked to Gilbert in another context entirely?No records give the date when the collector Dikran Garabed Kelekian (1867/68–1951), an art dealer active in Paris and New York from the 1890s onward, acquired the painting from Parisian dealer Jos Hessel. Kelekian and Gilbert may have known one another. They certainly shared deep enthusiasm for Middle Eastern antiquities.[13] Evidently Courbet was also a mutual interest (see, for example, The Met22.27.1).Asher Miller 2021[1] See Albert Boime,The Academy and French Painting in the Nineteenth Century, London, 1971.[2] Louvre inv. Ma 527 and Musei Capitolini inv. MC0747. For an introduction to these sculptures, see Francis Haskell and Nicholas Penny,Taste and the Antique: The Lure of Classical Sculpture, 1500–1800, New Haven, 1981, pp. 221–27, nos. 43–44.[3] Steuben is the subject of summary entries in standard biographical dictionaries but has not been treated to in-depth study. He was born in Bauerbach in the Grand Duchy of Baden (now Germany) and moved to Paris to study with François Gérard (1770–1837). He exhibited at the Paris Salon from 1812 onward, and was appointedmaître de dessin, or drawing professor, at the prestigious Ecole Polytechnique in 1831, but took leave, perhaps in 1843, to move to Russia. There he remained for many years before returning to Paris, where he died. It is not known when Steuben opened a private atelier.[4] Suisse’s full name and life dates were communicated to the author by Stanislav Volkov (emails, 2019 and 2021, Department of European Paintings files). Courbet would open a teaching studio at 82 rue Notre-Dame-des-Champs on December 9, 1861 and closed it in April 1862; see Dominique Lobstein, “Chronology,” in Dominique de Font-Réaulx, Laurence des Cars, Michel Hilaire, et al.,Gustave Courbet, exh. cat., Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, 2008, p. 435.[5] Despite the survival of many of Courbet’s letters, some of which are quoted below, there are gaps in the knowledge of Courbet’s early years in Paris. One source, which provides a sense of the texture and spirit of the artist’s trajectory during those years, is the first installment of the three-part article by Courbet’s friend Jules Antoine Castagnary (1830–1888), “Fragments d’un livre sur Courbet,”Gazette des Beaux-Arts5 (1911), pp. 5–20; 6 (1912), pp. 488–97; 7 (1912), pp. 19–29; English trans. by Petra ten-Doesschate Chu, “A Biography of Courbet,” in Chu, ed.,Courbet in Perspective, Englewood Cliffs, 1977, pp. 6–22.[6] Inventory no. 893.16.19; see Robert Fernier,La vie et l'oeuvre de Gustave Courbet, vol. 1,Peintures, 1819–1865, Lausanne, 1977, pp. 18–19, no. 30, ill.

Insofar as The Met’sStudy of a Nude Manrecalls theBorghese Gladiator(see n. 2, above), it may be notable with respect toThe Wrestlersthat four marble reliefs depicting athletes (Musée du Louvre inv. MR2673–MR2676), including pairs of wrestlers, were incorporated into theGladiator’s base in the eighteenth century by the Italian sculptor Agostino Penna (d. 1800).[11] Frédérique Giess, email to the author, September 26, 2020.[12] SeeCollection de M. J. Gilbert, artiste peintre: Verre, Bronzes, Terre cuite, Ivoire: Antiquités recueillies en Syrie, sale catalogue, Hôtel Drouot, Paris, January 23–24, 1903, p. [2].[13] One of the two objects that Gilbert sold to the Louvre is a ring described as “anneau, trouvé en Syrie,” inv. no. untraced; the other is a stone head, inv. AO 3748. Two other objects, which passed through Gilbert’s 1903 collection sale, are now in the Walters Art Museum, Baltimore: one of these was acquired from Kelekian. The author thanks Yelena Rakic and Anne Elizabeth Dunn-Vaturi for providing the present whereabouts of these objects, since the provenance of these or other antiquities formerly owned by Gilbert may lead to additional biographical information that links him to Courbet.",
        "Technical Notes": "The format is close to square. Though not a standard format, the height approximates a standard size 20 or 30 (73 cm). The plainly woven, medium weight canvas has a somewhat open weave, with numerous slubs and irregularities as viewed from the reverse. It is unlined and attached to a 5-member stretcher with metal sprigs (bent wires used in place of tacks before the days of staples). It appears never to have been unstretched. The tacking edges were cut to the width of the stretcher.On the reverse, beads of sizing have seeped through the open weave of the canvas. The canvas appears to have a very thin white ground, likely rich in lead white, and exhibiting protrusions characteristic of metal soaps, which might be confirmed by further analysis.Large splinters of what appear to be charcoal in the paint (and which are dark or absorbing due to their carbon content when imaged with infrared reflectography) indicate that this material was used for laying in the figure and then brushed aside (see fig. 4 above).[1] They were not fully brushed away and were fixed by the subsequent paint layer. The infrared reflectogram also shows fine painted contours, for example, around the nose, the shadowed side of the arm, and the stool. The sequence of painting follows established academic technique. The artist first reinforced the contours and blocked in the mid-toned shadows with a translucent warm brown “sauce.” He subsequently added the highlights of the model's flesh in bodied, brushy, lead-white-rich paint, worked wet-into-wet, with impasto in the nose, cheek, knuckles, thumbnail, and toes. He then adding the deepest shadows with thick strokes of translucent deep brown. The shadowed base of the nose was painted with a thick application of red lake. The handling is assured and bold, deftly conveying the dramatic fall of light, especially in the head and the hand. In the upper right, a constellation of brush-markings below the brown paint of the background record where the artist wiped paint from his brushes as he worked the model's flesh-tones. The background paint used by the artist to cover up the brush-marking is slightly darker than that of the rest. The wipings are partially visible to the naked eye and more fully evident by means of X-ray (see fig. 5).Charlotte Hale 2021[1] This is consistent with the technique described by Albert Boime inThe Academy and French Painting in the Nineteenth Century, London, 1971, p. 37. Infrared reflectography was completed with an OSIRIS InGaAs near-infrared camera with a 6-element, 150mm focal length, f/5.6 - f/45 lens; 900-1700nm spectral response.",

In an era when themes drawn from antiquity and the Bible stood at the head of an established hierarchy of subjects, the successful rendering of the unclothed male body was a benchmark of an artist’s formation. Few such works from Courbet’s earliest years survive, and the origins of this painting remain obscure.",

The elderly knight, accompanied by his squire, Sancho Panza, encounters the body of a dead mule, emaciated after long exposure to the elements in a wild landscape.

New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2000–.The Painting and its Context:The theme of Christ Taking Leave of His Mother is rather rare in Netherlandish painting and not found in biblical scriptures. Its source is theMeditaciones vite Christi(Meditations on the Life of Christ), a text that exerted enormous influence on Medieval spirituality, art, and literature.  It was originally thought to have been the work of Saint Bonaventure. However, in the eighteenth century, Benedict Bonelli realized that the author was John of Caulibus, a fourteenth-century Franciscan and native of San Gimignano, a town south-west of Florence. It has been hailed as “the first comprehensive biography of Christ containing regular and extensive interpolations of extra-Gospel narration.”[1] It blends the stories of Christ’s life with lengthy meditations on the Franciscan virtues of humility, poverty, love of prayer, and the imitation of Christ.[2]From the individual chapters devoted to the events of Christ’s life, it is clear that Caulibus was a gifted preacher who had a remarkable ability to pinpoint the spiritual essence of the story. In The Met’s painting, we find the visual counterpart to the emotionally wrenching event of chapter 72.  It tells how Christ must follow his destiny, leaving his Mother and friends at the house of Mary and Martha, and travel to Jerusalem for Passover, and ultimately to his arrest and death on the cross. Although his mother begs him not to go, Christ says: “Dearest Mother, it is the Father’s will that I celebrate Passover there. The time of redemption is at hand. Soon all that has been foretold about me will be fulfilled and they will do to me whatever they wish.”[3] The painting further illustrates the text: “Oh! In this outpouring of words see our Lady weeping, quietly and so plaintively, and Magdalen, like one intoxicated by her Master, crying loudly and sobbing uncontrollably. Then you too would be unable to hold back your tears.”[4]Jesus raises his right hand—in part, blessing his Mother, but also as an emphatic gesture to accompany his resolute words. The utterly forlorn expression on the Virgin’s face and her hands brought together in supplication convey the depth of her sorrow. Mary Magdalen, typically fashionably dressed, wipes away her tears  with her diaphanous veil, thus exemplifying the appropriate empathic response of the viewer. This is well coordinated with the text: “Then you too would be unable to hold back your tears.”  The third female figure squeezed in at the upper left must be Mary, who sat at Christ’s feet and faithfully listened to his teaching, while her sister Martha otherwise busied herself in their kitchen (Luke 10:38–42).As visually powerful as this image is, it represents only half of the intended theological lesson.  Early on, Max J. Friedländer (1912) recognized that this work is the pendant to theVirgin and Child with Music-making Angels, formerly in the Kahn Collection, and now in the Bearsted Collection (Upton House, Banbury; see fig. 1 above). The Virgin, as the new Eve, offers a piece of fruit to the Christ Child, the new Adam, signifying the sin of Adam and Eve and Christ’s Incarnation for the redemption of humankind. Like The Met’s work, the Upton House panel, equivalent in size, shows the same gold ground with stippling and feathered strokes emanating from the holy figures at the upper curved edge of the painting; similar trompe-l’oeil porphyry decorates the reverse of each panel (Ainsworth 1998, pp. 275–76). United as a diptych, the two paintings invite the viewer to meditate on the beginning and end of Christ’s life on earth. Hinged together, they could be opened and closed like a book, thus providing a reminder of the associated devotional texts.There are further connections with the Franciscans, in addition to the aforementioned fact that John of Caulibus, a member of that order, wrote theMeditations on the Life of Christfrom which the imagery derives. The Franciscans were major purveyors of Byzantine icons to the West, and this particular type of diptych has forerunners in Byzantine or Italo-Byzantine painting.[5] The diptych of theVirgin and Child with Archangels Raphael and Gabrieland theCrucifixionof around 1275–85 by a painter from the ancient Byzantine and Crusader city of Acre (Art Institute of Chicago, Reyerson Collection; fig. 2), or theVirgin and Childand theMan of Sorrows, Umbrian, around 1250–60 (National Gallery, London) are examples that urge meditation on the first and last stages of Christ’s life.[6] Such diptychs or double-sided icons had roots in Byzantine theology of the Iconoclastic and post-Iconoclastic periods, which advocated that the “birth and death of Christ were the two momentspar excellencein which his full humanity was exemplified.” [7] These images became ideal devotional aids for the Franciscans who, above all, promoted the imitation of Christ’s humanity.The Franciscans were among the mendicant orders that established themselves in Flanders. The order known as the Friars Minor was established in 1221 near Bruges, and they built their cloister in the town’s center in 1254 (destroyed by the Iconoclasts in 1578, rebuilt 1598–1611, and again destroyed in 1798).[8] The church of the Franciscan cloister benefitted from the patronage of Duke Philip the Good in 1451 for stained glass windows, and rich merchant communities—especially the Florentines and Castilians—were involved with the decoration of the Chapel of the Holy Cross earlier on in the fifteenth century.[9] Most importantly, the prestigious Confraternity of the Dry Tree met at the church of the Friar’s Minor, in a chapel on the north side of the choir. Its members included the Burgundian dukes (from Philip the Good to Philip the Fair), courtiers, the city’s upper-class families, wealthy foreign merchants, and even the most important artists of Bruges, such as Petrus Christus and Gerard David.[10]The reformed branch of the Franciscans, the Friars Observants, orRecolletten, built a cloister just outside the city walls of Bruges, near the Ezelspoort in about 1466, benefitting from land donated by Tommaso Portinari (see14.40.626–27). Again, members of the ducal family, namely Margaret of York and Mary of Burgundy, offered generous support and gifts, and the Spanish merchants acquired a chapel in the church of the cloister, richly embellishing it with stained glass windows.[11] The latter continued their support of both the Friars Minor as well as the reformed Friars Observants, as is emphasized in a charter of about 1500.[12]Considering the particular prominence of the Franciscans in the Bruges community, and the direct association of such artists as Petrus Christus and Gerard David with this order, it is not surprising to find small, locally-produced diptychs—like the Upton House-Met example—that catered specifically to the devotional interests of this order. One can imagine such diptychs employed both by the Franciscan monks for their daily prayers in their individual cells, or by devout parishioners at home. As a significant number of the latter were Spanish merchants, it is interesting to note that The Met’sChrist Appearing to His Motherwas acquired in Spain where perhaps early on it was transported from Bruges (see Provenance and Notes concerning the modern frame).The Attribution and Date:From its initial mention by Eberhard von Bodenhausen and Wilhelm R. Valentiner (1911), this work has been attributed to Gerard David with few dissenting voices (see Refs.). The Christ type is familiar from David’s other works both on a small scale, such as theChrist Blessing(2009.415), and those on a larger scale, such as theDeposition(Frick Collection, New York), theTransfiguration(Onze-Lieve-Vrouwekerk, Bruges), and theBaptism of Christ(Groeningemuseum, Bruges), all from the period around 1500–1510. The forlorn, aged Virgin and the Mary Magdalen types are also reminiscent of similar figures in the FrickDeposition.Added to these paintings are two additional diptychs also by David and a single panel that represent the same themes as the Upton House-Met pair. The slightly earlier diptychs of around 1490–95 in the Alte Pinakothek, Munich and the Kunstmuseum, Basel (figs. 3, 4) are forerunners of the Upton House-Met pair of around 1500 (Hand, Metzger, and Spronk 2006). The apparent popularity of these diptychs, most likely due to demand from the local Bruges Franciscans, was the impetus for adjustments David made in his working procedures in order to more efficiently and quickly produce them. While infrared reflectography of the BaselChrist Taking Leave of His Mothershows a detailed underdrawing in pen, the later Met panel of the same subject works out the altered composition in a rough black chalk sketch. The Upton HouseVirgin and Childreveals pouncing in its preparatory underdrawing, thereby suggesting that it perhaps was a composition produced in even greater numbers in a streamlined fashion (Ainsworth 1998, pp. 272–76). It could serve as an independent painting, as the Virgin was especially venerated by the Franciscans, or it could be joined withChrist Taking Leave of His Motherto form a diptych, thus appealing to the various wishes of the buyer. There also exists a much larger-scale version by David ofChrist Taking Leave of His Mother(47 1/16 x 24 3/16 in.) of around 1498–1511/15 in the National Gallery of Ireland, Dublin. It likely was the left wing of a triptych, the remainder of which has not survived.[13] Leaving no question about its theme, the painting includes in Latin the text from chapter 72 of theMeditations of the Life of Christ, \" vale mea dulcissima mater, iam / vado immolari pro salte hominum (Farewell my sweeter mother, I go now to be offered for the salvation of mankind).\"Maryan W.

        "Notes": "Jesse Dennis, 1981, confirms that the coat-of-arms on the frame pertains to a man descended from a marriage at some time in the past between a man of the Gevenich family, princes of Juliers (quarterly 1 and 4), and a lady of  the De Looz family, princes of Liège (2 and 3). He himself was married to an heiress of the Henriquez de Luna family (central shield). The color code of the engraved lines used in these arms only came into general use at the end of the seventeenth century so the frame could not be contemporary with the picture. Mrs. Dennis thinks the frame is likely to be a later do-over of a sixteenth- or late fifteenth-century armorial, of an alliance that was actual then. The nature of the engraving looks nineteenth-century to her, but she believes it could be the perpetuation of an old and right armorial.",

        "Catalogue Entry": "Joseph Anton Koch’s fame as the most important painter of the German classical tradition rests on iconic images such asHeroic Landscape with Rainbowof 1824. He painted four versions between 1805 and 1824, culminating in this final one. The series renewed the \"heroic\" seventeenth-century landscape tradition of Poussin and Claude Lorrain, and established the artist as the most influential landscape painter in Rome. Koch spent his entire career in that city, except for a brief interlude in Vienna (1812–15). In Rome he became an admired figure and teacher to the next generation of German Romantic painters, among them Karl Friedrich Schinkel and the Nazarenes.Koch did not describe these pictures as \"heroic,\" but as his \"Greek\" landscapes. Steeped in classical writings and poetry, he drew inspiration from Poussin’s landscapes, even though they were known to him only through engravings. He transcended that influence, however, through an intimate knowledge and acute observation of nature. He gained this experience while growing up in a small Tyrolean mountain valley, and later while crossing the Alps on foot on his way to Rome and Naples in 1794. Equally important were Koch’s vivid impressions of the time he spent on the coast of the Gulf of Salerno on his walking tour from Naples to Paestum in 1795. In a letter of 1814 he discussed this painting’s subject matter: \"It is an area, as you would imagine Great (Ancient) Greece. I found the motive in the beautiful surroundings of Salerno on the way to Paestum, with antique towns bathed in striking light. One can also see the sea with mountains in shades of blue in the background. Shepherds and shepherdesses are partly in the brilliant light, partly in the shadow.\"Koch brilliantly distilled the multitudes of this rich Mediterranean landscape into a magically ordered universe. From the bucolic foreground the eye is led by clear compositional lines over copses and lush river valleys to sunny plateaus and rugged mountains. Classical and medieval towns built on slopes descend down to the sea on the left. A thunderstorm has just passed. Dark clouds move off to the right. The main feature is the rainbow whose perfect arch shimmers before grey clouds, torn open in various places to reveal the blue of the sky. A shepherd leans on a rock on the left and plays his flute-like instrument. His two companions point to the rainbow and celebrate nature’s restored tranquility after the danger of the storm. Exceptional details abound: the ferns and wildflowers in the foreground are rendered with the poetic exactitude evoking Dürer. A family and boatman in a barge are reflected in the river’s water on the right, which also mirrors a segment of the rainbow. A woman in white accompanied by a child in the mid-distance carries a basket on her head. Small staffage figures move on roads leading to the town’s gate. Sailboats both distant and near float on the sea on the left. Dramatic clouds tear through the sky, along with a flock of white large birds.Koch usually made three or four versions of his important paintings. The original idea forHeroic Landscape with Rainbowgoes back to the artist’s watercolorVietri on the Gulf of Salerno(Akademie der Künste, Vienna) that he created during his walking trip in that region in 1795. Ten years later, in 1805, he paintedalla primaand on rough canvas his first version (Staatliche Kunsthalle, Karlsruhe) for the owner of the Café Greco. Located on Via Condotti and still existing today, the café was the meeting place of the German artists in Rome. That same year, Koch began a much larger and more detailed second version (Neue Pinakothek, Munich) on which he labored for the next ten years, completing it in 1815. A large chalk drawing (Germanisches Museum, Nürnberg) and a small painting (formerly private collection, Hamburg), both of 1806, show the Munich version before the artist’s decade-long reworking. In this work of 1824, Koch returned to the original version of 1805. A precise black ink drawing for this painting is in the collection of the Staatliche Kunsthalle, Karlsruhe.[Sabine Rewald 2012]",
        "Technical Notes": "The painting is exceptionally well preserved.The support is a medium-weight, plainly woven canvas, attached to a five-member keyed stretcher using metal sprigs (bent metal wires). The canvas is unlined and appears never to have been removed from its original stretcher.The support was prepared (probably in Koch’s studio) with a cream-colored ground, which provides a reflective surface for the overlying paint and contributes to the overall luminosity of the image. The ground (which is on the picture surface only, not the tacking edges) was applied with a knife, as seen in the build-up at some of the edges. The painted composition begins approximately 5mm within the ground application, so that there is a thin, cream-colored border at the perimeter visible when the painting is unframed. On this unpainted border can be seen graphite marks and numbers at intervals that must relate to a grid system used to transfer the image. (No grid lines were observed using infrared reflectography, but the artist may have used threads instead.) There is also an illegible notation in pen at the mid-right edge.Koch executed an extensive underdrawing in pen using a fluid, carbon containing medium which can be imaged using infrared reflectography (see fig. 1 above). Every element of the composition is underdrawn in detail: figures, buildings, foliage (including individual leaves and flowers), even clouds, distant rain, and reflections in the water. Despite the extremely detailed nature of the underdrawing, it is done with great freedom and assurance.The very full underdrawing is essentially invisible from the surface of the painting, which is worked quite densely. The palette is broad and the painting is richly colored. It is possible that there has been a degree of fading of organic red lake in the rainbows, and in the clouds at the upper right, but this cannot be quantified. Otherwise, the paint is very well preserved. It is worth noting that the brown leaves seem to have been painted as such—possibly in imitation of the discolored copper greens seen in Italian paintings until the end of the sixteenth century.Charlotte Hale 2014",

In 1818 he traveled to Italy, and died at thirty-one in 1819, shortly after his return to England.Harlow was admitted to the Accademia di Belle Arti, Florence, in 1818, and at that time presented his self-portrait to the Galleria degli Uffizi (oil on canvas, 29 x 24 3/8 in., inscribed \"G. H. Harlow / Academician of St Luke / Rome. 1818\"). The present painting is not a copy of the Uffizi picture, as has been suggested (Webster 1971), but instead seems to be a preliminary study. The changes in The Met's work, apparently indicated by the artist, would be atypical for a replica or a later variant, whether by Harlow himself or another hand. There are various differences: the figured pattern of the curtain at the left is simpler, the sunset in the background is less bold, and the tassel, rope, and curtain at the right are not as highly finished. Even so, the technique, much the same in both, is that of someone working rapidly and with limited interest in finishing detail. As the two differ markedly in style from Harlow’s work as a fashionable society portraitist, it is possible that he thought of them as costume pieces. Vain and theatrical in the extreme, he once painted a small whole-length of himself as Romeo (whereabouts unknown).There are two closely related figure drawings: a pencil study by John Jackson (National Portrait Gallery, London) and a second study in ink heightened with white (whereabouts unknown). Comparison with other Harlow self-portraits suggests that both drawings may be by Jackson. A replica in miniature was formerly in the collection of Lionel U. Grace (see Roe 1919), and the same or another is said to have been at Christie's, South Kensington, in October 1988, but cannot be traced further.[2012; adapted from Baetjer 2009]",

        "Catalogue Entry": "The Artist:For a biography of Dieric Bouts, see the Catalogue Entry forVirgin and Child(30.95.280).The Painting and its Subject:The Nursing Madonna, orMaria lactans, was one of the most popular subjects in Early Netherlandish painting, as well as another type, the so-calledGlykophilousatype (or Affectionate Virgin; see30.95.280). The representation of the nursing Virgin originates with Early Christian Coptic Egyptian and ByzantineTheotokos Galaktotrophousa, of which the iconographic origin may ultimately be traced back to PtolemaicIsis Lactans(see, for example,45.4.4;2021.41.39).[1] TheMaria Lactansbecame an especially favored subject in the late medieval Catholic world, on both sides of the Alps, in the wake of private devotional practices. Numerous examples from the Burgundian Netherlands still survive, which enables us to trace the genealogy of compositional types and variations since the generation of Robert Campin (ca. 1375–1444) and Jan van Eyck (d. 1441).[2]Following the basic format common both for theMaria Lactansand theGlykophlousa, The Met’s painting shows the figures in a spatially ambiguous setting closed off by a cloth of honor that covers the entire background. Since the original frame is lost, it is uncertain whether The Met’sVirgin and Childwas originally conceived as an independent panel or as part of a devotional diptych paired with the portrait of a donor in prayer (see, for example, the Catalogue Entry for14.40.626–27).In comparison with the numerous surviving images of theMaria lactans, the iconographic oddity of The Met panel is the red-beaded necklace worn by the Christ Child. The translucent red beads of equal size exclude the possibility that the necklace functions as a paternoster for prayer (as in1975.1.130) or an apotropaic coral necklace (as in1982.60.47). This type of purely decorative red necklace worn by the Child is not found in any other fifteenth-century Netherlandish paintings, whereas there are several fifteenth-century Italian examples (see65.234). Close observation under the microscope suggested that the necklace of the Child is probably a later addition (see Technical Notes).Furthermore, there remains a trace of a pearl fillet on the Virgin’s forehead which is now painted out yet can still be seen in the x-radiograph (see Technical Notes and fig. 1 above). The state before the overpainting is clearly visible in the photo reproduction of 1924 (fig. 2; Rieffel 1924, pp 56–57, pl. XV.). Although it was quite common to represent the Virgin with a headband in early Netherlandish painting, its arc was always depicted higher on the forehead (see, for example,30.95.280). In contrast, in the 1924 photo, the arc circles downward with lavish pearls, reminiscent of contemporary Italian examples, such as theVirgin and Childby Carlo Crivelli (49.7.5). Max J. Friedländer wrote about our panel, on which there are “strange decorative chains on the Virgin's forehead and the child's neck” (Friedländer 1925, p. 127; Friedländer 1968, p. 73.), whereas the exhibition catalogue of 1929, a year after the painting’s purchase by Jules S. Bache from art dealer Joseph Duveen, shows The Met’s painting with the pearl fillet already painted out as it is now (Sperling 1929, no. 14). The motif was clearly overpainted due to Friedländer’s advice to the dealer. In the correspondence dated November 2, 1928, he stated “I believe that the beads on the forehead of the Madonna are not genuine and spoil the picture. Perhaps you will have a cautious restorer try to see whether this unsuitable ornament can be wiped out” (Duveen 1927; Friedländer 1937, p.91; Friedländer 1968, pp. 88–89).[3] In this correspondence, Friedländer only mentioned the fillet, which might explain the reason why the necklace remained untouched before the sale of the painting to Bache in 1928. Although The Met’s technical investigation provided neither a specific date for the addition of the necklace, nor concrete evidence showing the fillet as a later addition (see Technical Notes), the two decorative motifs may have been added together at some point by an owner with Italianate taste.The Attribution and Date:In the previous scholarship (Schöne 1938, p. 215, no. 146; Campbell 1998, p. 56; Sprinson de Jesús 1998, pp. 230–31), The Met’sVirgin and Childhas generally been regarded as executed by a less-skilled assistant in the workshop, or a follower of Dieric Bouts, modelled on theVirgin and Childat the National Gallery, London (fig. 3). In the London painting, unanimously considered as by Dieric Bouts himself (Campbell 1998, pp. 56–59), thelactansgroup is located in a domestic setting with an open window view. By contrast, The Met panel shows the figures before a brocade cloth of honor covering the entire background. Without the motif of the cushion on the windowsill of the London panel, the Christ Child in The Met panel is shown in a spatially ambiguous position, as if his naked body is hovering in the air rather than sitting securely on the lap of the Virgin. This oddity is often regarded as the result of the omission of the cushion motif in the copying process, thereby being an indication that The Met Virgin was made as a reduced copy based on the London prototype by an artist of inferior skill (Sprinson de Jesús 1998, p. 230).[4] Still, The Met’s painting shares some prominent features with the London panel such as the idealized facial type of the Virgin, the positions of her hands, and the ‘pomegranate’-patterned embroidered cloth of honor (Monnas 2008, p. 355).Nonetheless, The Met’s painting seems to be more of a hybrid of the London prototype and a Rogerian type. The lactating Virgin with an embroidered cloth of honor was influential already in the generation before Bouts, as seen in the Master of Flémalle’sMadonna and Child, Van Eyck’sLucca Madonna, or Rogier’sSaint Luke Drawing the Virgin(fig. 4). This iconographic combination of theMaria lactansand the embroidered cloth of honor was adopted quickly into the traditional half-length format of the Virgin and Child image, especially in the circle of Rogier.[5] In Rogerian lactating images, the Christ Child’s position is often ambiguous in the pictorial space, including the position of a cushion on Mary’s lap.[6] These panels also feature, in common with The Met’s Virgin, the white headscarf, one end of which runs over the hair and the bosom, together with the breastfeeding arm in an embroidered sleeve of her gown. These details are not found in the London prototype, indicating that The Met’s panel was modelled also on this type of Rogerian nursing image, which had probably originated from Rogier’s BostonSaint Luke. Bouts’s contact with Rogier is open to question, unlike the case of Hans Memling, who shows, especially in his early works, a close stylistic affinity with the underdrawing techniques of Rogier (see17.190.7).The hybrid origin does not, however, designate The Met Virgin a pastiche status. For example, the resemblance of the Virgin’s face to the London prototype deserves scrutiny. When the two panels are overlapped with each other, despite the different measurements of the two panels, it becomes clear that the Virgins’ heads are painted roughly in the same placement. Some features, such as the proper right eye, bridge of the nose, and mouth, match well, but not exactly, in size and position with each other (fig. 5), whereas the other parts do not overlap, being in different sizes and positions. The infrared reflectography of The Met panel reveals that the underdrawing was likely to have been executed freehand, showing some spontaneity in the contour lines (fig. 6; see Technical Notes). It appears different from the rigid and schematic underdrawing that is typical of a transfer (in contrast to, for example,71.156–57),[7] suggesting that the near-identical facial features in The Met’s painting were the result of freehand copying based on the London prototype or a common pattern.Although condition issues make it difficult to assess the painting technique, especially in the flesh tones (see Technical Notes),[8] The Met’s panel seems to lack the attention to detail that is typical in the autograph works of Bouts. For example, the comparison of the cloth of honor demonstrates different hands in the two panels. The London panel exhibits meticulous cross-hatching in varied colors in the embroidery on the cloth, whereas our panel mostly shows parallel hatching in yellow (fig. 7). The latter, therefore, fails to convey the detailed effects of light reflecting on the embroidery threads. These observations provide additional evidence that The Met’sVirgin and Childwas not executed by Dieric Bouts himself.For further discussions on the attribution of this panel, it is helpful to study the x-radiography of The Met’s panel. The autograph works of Bouts, such as The Met’s30.95.280, exhibit his careful, selective build-up of lead white paint to establish the volume of forms, especially in the flesh tones,[9] and the x-radiograph of The Met’slactanspanel shows, under the abraded and retouched paint surface, a similar distribution of lead white (see fig. 1 and Technical Notes). This, together with the observations above, indeed suggests that The Met Virgin was executed in the workshop of Dieric Bouts, although it is impossible to say if this was before or after the death of the master in 1475. In the Burgundian Netherlands, manyMaria lactansimages were produced in the second half of the fifteenth century. This small panel eloquently demonstrates the enterprise of the Bouts workshop in reaction to the popular demand for this intimate devotional image in the time of the Devotio Moderna.Sumihiro Oki 2022[1] Sabrine Higgins, “Divine Mothers: The Influence of Isis on the Virgin Mary in Egyptian Lactans-Iconography.”Journal of the Canadian Society for Coptic Studies3–4 (2012), pp. 71–90.[2] Dirk de Vos, “De Madonna-en-Kindtypologie bij Rogier van der Weyden en enkele minder gekende Flemalleske voorlopers.”Jahrbuch der Berliner Museen13 (1971), pp. 60–161.[3] Duveen 1927. In the correspondence, November 8, 1928, Friedländer wrote, “I studied this picture [49.7.18] very carefully some weeks ago at München and am quite sure now, that it is characteristic work by Dieric Bouts.” It is noteworthy that this comment postdates the publication of Volume III ofDie Altniederländische Malerei, in which the author attributes The Met panel more negatively as a close replica of a copy of theVirgin and Child, the autograph work now in the National Gallery in London. See Friedländer 1925, p. 127; Friedländer 1968, p. 73. Later, he changed the attribution of The Met’s painting to “an original by Dieric Bouts” since the “disfiguring restorative work has been removed.” See Friedländer 1937, p. 91; Friedländer 1968, pp. 88–89.[4] Sprinson de Jesús 1998, p. 230. The composition of the London panel was certainly influential. Many variations still survive including the German example at The Met (22.96), or even theMadonna and Childby Giovanni Bellini shows a distant echo (08.183.1).[5] See, De Vos 1971.[6] See, for example: Rogier van der Weyden,Virgin and Child, left wing of theDiptych of Jean Gros, Musée des Beaux-Arts, Tournai, inv. 481; Workshop of Rogier van der Weyden,Virgin and Child, Art Institute of Chicago, inv. 1933.1052; Follower of Rogier van der Weyden (Master of the Saint Ursula Legend Group),Virgin and Child(The Met,17.190.16.[7] Maryan W. Ainsworth,Facsimile in Early Netherlandish Painting: Dieric Bouts's \"Virgin and Child\", Exh. cat., New York, 1993, pp. 9–10. The matching of the eye, nose, and mouth with the London panel is also found in theMaria lactanspanel in the Städel Museum in Frankfurt (inv. 1217), of which x-ray shows the typical Boutsian handling of the lead white in the flesh tones. See, Jochen Sander,Niederländische Gemälde im Städel,1400–1550, Mainz 1993, pp. 47–58.[8] Note that The Met’s panel is quite abraded and has a discolored varnish layer. The current matte appearance does not necessarily reflect the original appearance of the hanging (see Technical Notes).[9] Ainsworth 1993. esp. pp. 12–14. Her attributions are unanimously accepted. For example, see Périer-d'Ieteren 2006, pp. 126–33.",
        "Technical Notes": "Support:The support was constructed from a single plank of oak with the grain oriented vertically. The oak originated in the Baltic/Polish regions. Dendrochronological analysis indicated an earliest possible creation date of 1437 and a more plausible creation date of 1439 onwards.[1] At some point before entering The Met’s collection, the panel was thinned to about 5 mm and cradled. The unpainted wood margins were also largely cut away, although a few millimeters remain on all edges. In addition, there are traces of a barbe on all edges, indicating that the original dimensions of the painted composition are preserved and that the panel was prepared in an engaged frame.Preparation:The panel was prepared with a white ground. Examination with infrared reflectography revealed the presence of an underdrawing executed using a liquid material.[2] The medium was quite dilute in some passages; see where it pooled in the Child’s left fingers, or at the Child’s proper left eye, where the medium was so dilute that it was apparently smudged when still wet. The artist laid out all the important contours of the two figures and their drapery in his underdrawing and added a good deal of hatching. The hatchmarks vary in boldness, seemingly due to the fluctuating dilution of the artist’s underdrawing medium. They are also quite irregular in their application, sometimes running in random directions, as in the Virgin’s forehead, and sometimes quite unevenly spaced, as in the strokes in the Child’s chest. This irregularity suggests that the artist added the hatchmarks hastily, in a summary fashion.The underdrawing seems to have been executed freehand. The contour lines are simple but have some spontaneity, as opposed to the rigid and schematic appearance characteristic of a directly transferred pattern. The composition could well have been copied from a prototype; however, the artist did feel at liberty to adjust his underdrawn design in the painting stage, such as in the left hands of both the Child and the Virgin.Paint Layers:Assessment of the painting technique is complicated by condition. It was quite abraded at some point in the past, as can be seen most easily in the brown passages, particularly the Virgin’s hair and the shading of the fleshtones, and in the red brocade on the Virgin’s sleeve. The flesh tones also appear rather abraded, but the extent of this is more difficult to evaluate beneath the current restoration. There is a good deal of retouching, likely more extensive than truly necessary, that has itself discolored. The painting has a thick and somewhat discolored varnish, which also negatively impacts the overall appearance.Select passages where the original is better preserved offer a more accurate understanding of the artist’s technique. The Child’s proper left eye is only slightly abraded and hardly retouched, and here the artist’s attention to detail in the eye—the highlight on the white of the eye and the catchlight in the iris—are evident, suggesting a higher overall quality than the painting’s current appearance does. The lighting on the cloth of honor does not seem to reflect an accurate lighting scheme. Examination of the x-radiograph (see fig. 1 above) gives a sense of the handling of the flesh tones. Lead white was used sparingly, with not as precise a handling as seen in works attributed to Bouts himself, such as The Met’sVirgin and Child(see the x-radiograph and Technical Notes for30.95.280), but still comparable. In general, the condition hinders evaluation of the technique and quality, and so consideration of the composition is valuable in assessing the relationship of this painting to the other versions (see Catalogue Entry).There was once a pearl fillet on the Virgin’s forehead, as can be seen in a photograph from 1924 (fig. 2). Examination under the microscope revealed that these pearls were painted out at some point after the 1924 photograph and, indeed, evenly spaced and sized circles can be seen in the x-radiograph, painted in a radio-opaque material. A trace of gold leaf was evident between one pearl and the next during microscopic examination, suggesting that mordant gilding was also used in the fillet. The fillet, an unusual detail in the Virgin and Child compositions of this type and date, could be a later addition to the painting, but analysis would be required to shed further light on its date.The Child’s red necklace appears to be a later addition to the painting. In a few instances, the red paint of the beads slightly overlaps cracks in the paint of the Child’s flesh, indicating that the red was applied over already aged paint. The red beads appear rather two-dimensional, but abrasion does not entirely explain this appearance; on close inspection they were not made with great skill. The string of the necklace is rather sloppy and some of the highlights on the beads are not accurately placed. See the Catalogue Entry for arguments regarding the historical incongruity of this necklace.Sophie Scully 2022[1] Wood identification and dendrochronological analysis completed by Dr. Peter Klein, Universität Hamburg, report dated May 23, 2015. The report can be found in the files of the Department of Paintings Conservation. “The youngest heartwood ring was formed out in the year 1422. Regarding the sapwood statistic of Eastern Europe an earliest felling date can be derived for the year 1435, more plausible is a felling date between 1435..1437…1441. With a minimum of 2 years for seasoning an earliest creation of the painting is possible from 1437 upwards. Under the assumption of a median of 15 sapwood rings and 2 years for seasoning a creation is plausible from 1439 upwards.”[2] Infrared reflectography was acquired with an OSIRIS InGaAs near-infrared camera fitted with a 6-element, 150 mm focal length f/5.6–f/45 lens; 900-1700 nm spectral response.

        "Catalogue Entry": "Janet Law was the third daughter and one of seven children of Janet Pilmor Law and Mungo Law of Pittillock, Fife. Her father was a major in the Royal Scots Greys. Janet first married Walter Wemyss of Lathockar, Fife, in 1775, and later Colin Lauder, M.D., and died without issue. In 1770 her sister Isabella married John Berry of Tayfield, Fife. In the sale catalogues of 1912 and 1926 (see Provenance), Janet is confused with her sister Isabella. Raeburn also painted Janet's sister Agnes and her husband, Captain George Makgill of Kemback and Fingask, Fife. Those two portraits were included in the Holms sale of 1912 with the present work. Logic would suggest that Janet's portrait may have descended in the family of Captain and Mrs. Makgill, though no evidence to that effect has been found.The picture must date from the 1790s. It is first recorded in 1908.[2010; adapted from Baetjer 2009]",

        "Catalogue Entry": "This work andSaint Adalbert and Saint Procopius(The Met44.147.1) were originally the front and back of a single panel.Benesch (1945) identified the scene as an episode from the story of Wenceslas, and Kurth (1945), who recognized it as the saint’s entombment in the Cathedral of Saint Vitus in Prague, confirmed that both sides formerly belonged to the Saint Wenceslas Altarpiece. A legend, first reported by Cosmas Pragensis and later written down by Johannes Dubravius in theHistoriae Regni Boiemiae(Prostějov, 1552), relates that Boleslav, the brother and murderer of Wenceslas, transferred his body to the cathedral in hopes that the miracles taking place at the saint’s grave in Stará Boleslav would be instead attributed to Vitus. The background scene showing three haloed corpses lying on a bier—Vitus flanked by his foster parents, Modestus and Crescentia, all of whom were martyrs—is not mentioned in connection with the burial of Wenceslas in any of the known written narratives of that event.The altarpiece to which The Met's two works belonged comprised an unknown number of paintings depicting scenes from the life of Wenceslas (ca. 907–September 28, 935), Bohemian duke of the Přemyslid dynasty. Six of these are in the collection of the Národni Galerie, Prague:Saint Wenceslas Liberating the Prisoners,Saint Wenceslas Regaling Pilgrims in Stará Boleslav,Saint Wenceslas Collecting Firewood for the Poor and Being Tortured by the Gamekeepers,Saint Wenceslas Led by Angels and Welcomed by King Henry I the Fowler at the Reichstag,The Martyrdom of Saint Wenceslas, andThe Securing of the Body of Saint Wenceslas. Two others,Saint James the Minor and Saint VitusandSaint Wenceslas and Saint Ludmila, were sold at auction in April 1997 at Sotheby’s, London, and are now in a private collection in London. The panels of paired saints formed the exterior wings of the altarpiece, while the narrative episodes from the saint’s life were on the interior. Because of the unknown number of missing panels and the compromised state of the existing ones, it is not currently possible to determine whether the altarpiece was composed entirely of paintings or whether the paintings formed the wings of a shrine that had a sculpture of Saint Wenceslas at its center. All the panels have been split front from back, and all those in Prague have been thinned and cradled or backed with a plywood panel. As a result, it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to compare their wood grain patterns with those of the existing panels of paired saints in order to identify which are the front and back sides of the same panel.As early as 984, a feast day for Wenceslas had been established. By the eleventh century he was considered the Bohemian national saint, and he is still venerated today as the patron saint of the Czech Republic. The Saint Wenceslas Chapel in Saint Vitus Cathedral is decorated with an extensive mural depicting episodes from the saint’s life. It was here that the cult of Saint Wenceslas was especially supported by the Bohemian emperor Charles IV. The extant paintings belonging to the same altarpiece as The Met’s panels all derive from legends of Saint Wenceslas that date from the tenth to fourteenth centuries. TheLexikon der christlichen Ikonographieprovides as many as twenty-nine of these episodes, suggesting that the original altarpiece may have been much larger than indicated by the extant paintings. Unfortunately, no other altarpiece of the life of Saint Wenceslas is known to have survived, only murals and book illuminations.There is no question that the Museum’s panels belong to the core group of the Master of Eggenburg as established by Benesch (1932). Despite the cohesive but small group of paintings in the Master of Eggenburg’s oeuvre, his origin remains a matter of conjecture. Benesch thought he was an assistant to the Master of Herzogenburg, a late-fifteenth-century artist from northern Lower Austria, who worked in 1491 in Gars am Kamp, Waldviertel. Like Stange, Brinkmann (2002) considered the Master a contemporary of the Master of Herzogenburg but not his pupil. Brinkmann showed the striking similarities, especially in composition, between theLast Supperby the Master of Herzogenburg (Stiftskirche Heiligenkreuz, Lower Austria) and that by the Master of Eggenburg mentioned above. Although the two artists share tightly edited, heavily populated narrative scenes and straightforward, even naive treatments of figures, theirs is more a general than a specific relationship and supports Brinkmann’s view that the two are contemporaries. The Master of Herzogenburg’s Passion Altarpiece (formerly in Gars am Kamp and today divided between the Stiftsgalerie in Herzogenburg and Heiligenkreuz) is dated 1491; his two altarpiece wings with Saint George and Saint Leonard (Národni Galerie, Prague) also probably bear the same date, although the last digit is damaged and may be a 5 or a 6. As Brinkmann indicated, this provides a likely period of creation for the Master of Eggenburg’sBeheading of Saint John the Baptist(Städel Museum, Frankfurt). During the same period, the 1490s, the Master must have also worked on the Saint Wenceslas Altarpiece and therefore on the Museum’s paintings.[2014; adapted from Ainsworth in Ainsworth and Waterman 2013]",
        "Technical Notes": "This work andSaint Adalbert and Saint Procopius(44.147.1) were originally the front and back of a single, vertically oriented spruce panel that was later separated in two. After the separation, the remaining wood supports were thinned and cradled. Modern wooden strips, .5 centimeter wide and painted black, were nailed to the perimeter. On the reverse ofSaint Adalbert and Saint Procopius, pieces of wood of various sizes were inserted into the interstices of the cradle, and a wax coating was applied. Between the two saints, there is a split in the panel that extends from top to bottom. TheBurial of Saint Wenceslasdisplays several splits and washboarding of the surface plane because the cradle is restricting the natural movement of the wood support.Fragments of abarbe, unpainted wood borders at the left and right, and incised lines along the left, right, and top perimeters ofThe Burialindicate that the white ground preparation was applied when the panel was in an engaged frame. While the left and right edges of both panels are original, the unpainted wood borders at the tops have been trimmed up to the paint. The bottom edges have been cut; here the paint extends out to the very edges and is chipped and irregular. OnSaint Adalbert and Saint Procopiusa nonoriginal black border approximately 1 cm wide runs around the left, top and right edges. X-radiography ofSaint Adalbert and Saint Procopiusrevealed that, before the ground preparation was applied, fabric was attached to the panel in the area to be gilded. The elaborately patterned, burnished gold background, characteristic of water gilding, is applied to an orange-red bole.The paintings are generally well preserved.The Burialexhibits large losses at the foot of the open sarcophagus in the background, to the right of the central column, in the knees of Saint Wenceslas, in the altar at the top left, and below the feet of the man standing at the left. There are remnants of later fill material and black paint on the unpainted wood borders. The portion of Saint Wenceslas’s halo that extends onto the border is a restoration. InSaint Adalbert and Saint Procopiuslosses in the gold background and along the contour of Adalbert’s cope are associated with the central vertical split in the panel. Much of the bole and the white ground shows through the badly damaged gilded background. The damage appears deliberate and may have been done to efface the elaborately tooled background, which has been extensively restored with gold paint.Infrared photography (see figs. 1–3 above) revealed an extensive underdrawing, carried out with a brush, that describes the contours and uses hatching to suggest shading and modeling. The facial structures—most notably, the sunken cheeks and rounded eye sockets—were indicated in the underdrawing. When the surface was examined with the stereomicroscope, the dispersed black pigments of the underdrawing were visible in a skip in the paint in the neck of the figure at the right inThe Burial.To establish the pattern of Saint Adalbert’s gold-and-green brocade tunic, the artist used an instrument to score the ground, first laying down the outlines and then filling them in with parallel scoring. Layers of gesso were next added to make the raised-relief floral decoration. The low-relief pattern was gilded, and a brown glaze applied and wiped away, leaving traces in the interstices that created the impression of gold-thread embroidery. The gilded-leaf pattern was glazed with green. Brown glaze was brushed over the completed garment to produce the folds and shadows.Full-bodied paints have been generously applied in a straightforward manner. The good deal of visible wet-in-wet brushwork implies that the artist worked quickly and with facility. He employed a simple but effective technique to create volume by juxtaposing three to four color or shades of color.[2013; adapted from German Paintings catalogue]",

        "Catalogue Entry": "This superb early work by Claesz, in pristine condition, was long considered to date from 1623 until the question was revisited in 1982 at the request of Martina Brunner-Bulst, whose monograph of 2004 and the Claesz exhibition of 2004–5 now make clear that in style and subject matter the painting is typical of the late 1620s. Technical examination of the date inscribed on the painting confirms that it is intact and can be read only as 1628.The simplicity and directness achieved in this work were gradually distilled by Claesz over a period of several years, in which he could be said to have reached a moment of early maturity. TheVanitas Still Life with Brass Candlestick, Writing Materials, Letter, Pocket Watch, and Anemone, of 1625 (Frans Halsmuseum, Haarlem), continues the additive distribution of motifs found in earlier works, but reduces their number, focusing on two objects, the candlestick and the skull. TheVanitas Still Life with Violin and Glass Ball, of about 1628 (Germanisches Nationalmuseum, Nuremberg), is more complex and repeats the motifs and to some extent the placement of the lamp, pen, pen holder, inkwell,roemer(drinking glass), book, and folders of papers that are found in The Met's composition. Of known works by Claesz, it is not a vanitas picture with a skull but theStill Life with Books and Burning Candle, of 1627 (Mauritshuis, The Hague), that anticipates the Museum's work in its concentration, but the impression is of a small world of reflections and shadows, rather than that of a stark encounter with death in the light of day.The subject might be interpreted as one of the many variations on the theme of worldly accomplishments—writing, learning, dabbling in the arts—that ultimately come to nothing: all is vanity. The wisp of smoke in the lamp and the reflections in the glass are signs of fleeting existence common in Dutch paintings. Here the skull is not merely an intrusion into a world of human activity, but the familiar attribute of a scholar or philosopher. For the original owner of a work such as this one, the image probably expressed not only the vanity of knowledge but also the knowledge of vanity, much as a contemporary portrait of a person holding a skull conveyed the sitter's belief in a spiritual life after death.[2011; adapted from Liedtke 2007]",

        "Intro Description": "In this still life, close observation and realistic detail operate in tension with explicit symbolism. The toppled glass, gap-toothed skull, and guttering wick of an oil lamp all serve as stark symbols of life’s brevity. Working with a limited palette of grays and browns, Claesz carefully describes the surfaces of these unsettling objects. By arranging them on a pitted stone ledge, the artist connects the picture’s space to our own, making the message all the more compelling.",

        "Catalogue Entry": "Born in Dresden, Zincke was the son of a goldsmith. He studied with the Dresden painter Heinrich Christoph Fehling (1657–1725) and then settled in England about 1704–6, becoming the pupil of Charles Boit (1662–1727) in enamel painting. When Boit left for France in 1714, Zincke became the leading painter in miniature in England; he was patronized by George II (1683–1760) and Frederick, Prince of Wales (1707–1751), and had an enormous practice. His eyes began to trouble him by 1725, and Zincke undertook less work in his later years. To a large extent his enamels are paintedad vivumrather than being copies of existing portraits. His work is copiously represented in the British Royal Collection.The miniature entered the collection of The Met with an attribution to William Prewett (active 1735–50); this was changed for an attribution to Christian Friedrich Zincke on the advice of the Victoria and Albert Museum (1949). Although Daphne Foskett in 1965 accepted the attribution to Prewett, the style is fully in line with the signed and accepted late works of Zincke, from about 1745. The frame is contemporary.The miniature's enamel back is white and light greenish blue. A piece of tracing paper fixed to the back covers an ink inscription which has been partly transferred to this covering. It appears to be a dealer's note and price.[2016; adapted from Reynolds and Baetjer 1996]",

        "Catalogue Entry": "This painting reflects an important step in the evolution of Florentine portraits of women: earlier examples almost always show them bust-length and in profile. The change came about in the mid-1470s in the work of the young Leonardo da Vinci and, slightly later, in the work of Botticelli. In the new format, women turn their faces toward the spectator, giving artists greater opportunity to describe their personalities. By increasing the length of portraits, artists could include the sitters' hands and show the sitters in more natural poses.An old, probably sixteenth-century, inscription on the back of The Met's panel identifies the sitter as Ginevra d'Amerigo de' Benci, the same young woman whom Leonardo depicted in a portrait in the National Gallery of Art, Washington. Ginevra, the daughter of a wealthy Florentine banker, was born in 1457; in 1474 she married Luigi di Bernardo Niccolini. Leonardo probably painted her portrait about the time of their marriage. The Met's painting is clearly inspired by Leonardo's portrait. Although the pose of the sitter is reversed, the format of the two pictures is virtually the same, and the resemblance is even greater if one bears in mind that the portrait in Washington has been cut by about seven inches at the bottom and about one-half inch on the right side, so that both portraits originally were about the same size. Although a drawing by Leonardo in the Royal Library, Windsor Castle, has often been cited as a study for the missing hands of Leonardo's portrait in Washington, The Met's portrait probably provides more reliable evidence.The attribution to Lorenzo di Credi was proposed by Berenson (1896). Credi received his training in Andrea del Verrocchio's workshop when Leonardo da Vinci and Perugino were also employed there. Vasari wrote that \"since Lorenzo [di Credi] took an extraordinary pleasure in the manner of Leonardo, he contrived to imitate it so well that there was no one who came nearer to it than he did in the high finish and thorough perfection of his works\" (de Vere trans., 1996, vol. 1, p. 800). Credi's free copy of Leonardo'sBenois Madonnain the Gemäldegalerie, Dresden, not to speak of his variant of the Ginevra de' Benci in The Metropolitan Museum, lends credence to Vasari's account.The attribution to Credi is widely accepted today, though it occasionally has been questioned: Bode (1921) tentatively gave it to Credi's student Giovan Antonio Sogliani, Alazard (1924) dismissed it as \"a work of no great artistic value,\" and David Alan Brown (1998) ascribed it to the prolific follower of Credi known as Tommaso. Doubts about the attribution may be due to the portrait's compromised condition. Unlike Leonardo's picture in Washington, the surface of which is well preserved, The Met's version is badly abraded—the face is badly damaged, the dark pigments have deteriorated, and little detail remains in the clothing and the landscape. The surface is so poorly preserved that it shows no sign of the high finish for which Credi was known in his time.The poor condition of the portrait also precludes any firm conclusion about the identity of the sitter. Nevertheless, some scholars (Bode 1903, Walker 1967, Schuyler 1976, Garrard 2006) maintain that it portrays Ginevra de' Benci; while others (Carnescchi 1909, Sirén 1916, Alazard 1924, Brown 1998) believe that it does not. In the earliest published reproduction of the portrait (Bode 1903), in which it appears to be in much better condition than it is today, the sitter's features correspond closely with those of the Washington portrait. A radiograph of the The Met's panel shows various contours for the position of the woman's head, changes presumably due to the artist's inexperience. The radiograph also reveals that the neckline of her dress was originally rectangular and cut much lower, in fact, exactly like the neckline of the dress in the Washington portrait.Discounting the old inscription on the back, Gigetta Dalli Regoli (1966) suggested that the portrait depicts a different Ginevra—Ginevra di Giovanni di Niccolò, the reputed widow of Lorenzo di Credi's older brother Carlo, who was a goldsmith. The juniper foliage, behind the sitters' heads in both the New York and Washington portraits, alludes to their Christian name, the Italian word for the plant—ginepro—being a play on the name Ginevra. The ring held by the sitter in The Met's portrait could refer to her late husband's profession, but it might also have had some connubial significance. On balance, making allowances for its compromised condition, the portrait probably does represent Ginevra de' Benci.Dalli Regoli (1966) at first proposed that The Met's picture dates from about 1490–95. Thirty years later (1996) she wrote that the design of the portrait reflects Leonardo'sMona Lisa, thereby dating the picture considerably later, because Leonardo began theMona Lisaabout 1505 and did not complete it until 1514. Judging from style alone, The Met's portrait probably dates from the late 1470s when Credi copied early works by Leonardo.[2011; adapted from Fahy 2011]",

        "Intro Description": "An inscription on the back of this painting, possibly dating to the 1500s, identifies the subject as \"Ginevra d’Amerigo de Benci.\" The juniper bush (ginevroin old Italian) behind her could evoke her first name. The painting signals an important shift in Florentine portraits of women. Rather than appearing bust length and in strict profile, this sitter turns to the viewer, her hands visible, providing a greater sense of her inner psychology. The picture was likely inspired by Leonardo da Vinci’s portraitGinevra de’ Benciin the National Gallery of Art, Washington.",

        "Catalogue Entry": "Charlotte Sophia, daughter of the late Sir Francis Blake Delaval, married Sir Robert Smith, fifth Baronet, in 1776. He had been a member of Parliament for Cardigan borough and later, from 1780 to 1790, would be a member for Colchester; he died in Paris in 1802. Lady Smith died in 1823 and was buried at Versailles. The little boy is George Henry Smith, sixth Baronet (1784–1852), who changed the family name to Smyth. He was a member of Parliament for Colchester from 1826 to 1830 and from 1835 to 1850. Since he had no legitimate children, the baronetcy became extinct at his death. His sisters are Louisa, born in 1782, who married Thomas Este, and Charlotte, born in 1783, who married Charles Este in 1803.Sir Robert visited Reynolds on February 20, 1787, presumably to commission this portrait. His wife’s first appointment was two days later, and she had eleven sittings in all between February and April 1787; it is not clear how many of them involved the children. Sir Robert paid £162.10.0 in March for “Lady Smith and three children and likenesse for a fancy Child” and the further sum of £152.10.0 in May. The picture was exhibited at the Royal Academy that year asPortrait of a lady and three children.The painting was engraved by Francesco Bartolozzi in 1789 (The Met,42.108) and by R. Josey in 1880 (see Henry Graves,Engravings from the Works of Sir Joshua Reynolds, P.R.A. by S. W. Reynolds, and other Eminent Engravers, London, n.d., vol. 7, no. 20). An oval miniature by Samuel Shelley closely duplicates the portrait group but shows Lady Smith without her hat (sold, Sotheby's, London, July 11, 1977, no. 170, ill.).When the picture changed hands in 1878, it was described as much damaged by damp; afterward it was “carefully restored” (Hamilton 1884). Its condition is compromised by extensive drying cracks, particularly in the dark foliage.[2010; adapted from Baetjer 2009]",

The portrait was commissioned by the family’s father and husband, a baronet and member of Parliament. Expressing cultural ideals of femininity and upper-class childhood, this portrait was a popular exhibit at the Royal Academy in the year it was painted.",

        "Catalogue Entry": "In his biography of Van Dyck, Giovan Pietro Bellori described the young artist in Rome in 1622: \"he was still young, his beard barely sprouting, yet his youth was accompanied by grave modesty of character and nobility of mien, albeit he was small in stature. His manners were those of a lord rather than a commoner, and he appeared resplendent in rich attire of suits and court dress\" (\"era egli ancor giovine, spuntando di poco la barba, ma la giovinezza sua veniva accompagnata da grave modestia di animo e da nobiltà di aspetto, ancorché picciolo di persona. Erano le sue maniere signorili piú tosto che di uomo privato, e risplendeva in ricco portamento di abiti e divise\"). TheSelf-Portraitin The Metropolitan Museum is one of the earliest by the artist, and depicts him as a stylish gentleman rather than as a painter. The canvas is first described by John Evelyn on the occasion of a dinner, on 16 November 1677, which he attended with his son, at the house of the Lord Chamberlain, Henry Bennet, 1st Earl of Arlington. Evelyn recalled \"two Vandyke’s, of which one was his own picture at length, when young, in a leaning posture; the other an eunouch, singing. Rare pieces indeed!\" Through Arlington’s daughter, Isabella, the painting entered the collection of the dukes of Grafton, and there it was recorded by Horace Walpole (1828): \"at the Duke of Grafton’s is a fine half length of Vandyck by himself, when young, holding up his arm, the hand declined.\" It remained in the Grafton collection until sold at auction in 1923, and a year later it was acquired by Jules Bache in New York.The painting is closely related to two otherSelf-Portraitsin the State Hermitage Museum, St. Petersburg, and in the Alte Pinakothek, Munich. The dating of the three paintings and their relative chronology has been the source of much speculation. Smith (1831) originally proposed that the New York portrait dated from \"around the time he resided at Genoa,\" but Lionel Cust (1900) already noticed that it was more likely painted before 1621. TheSelf-Portraitis particularly close to Van Dyck’s work from his first Antwerp period. However, the provenance suggests, as rightly proposed by Walter Liedtke (1984), that the painting should date from the artist’s first English sojourn, around 1620–21. The flesh tones and the hands in theSelf-Portraitare particularly close in treatment to the ones in theContinence of Scipio(Christ Church Picture Gallery, Oxford) painted around 1620–21 in London, probably for the duke of Buckingham.TheSelf-Portraitwas painted over a re-used canvas, and the portrait of a man with a moustache is visible in x-ray photographs of the work, to the left of the artist’s head. The twenty-one-year-old painter was already clearly influenced by Venetian portraiture— especially by Titian—in his refined technique, and in creating a supremely sophisticated image. The MunichSelf-Portraitwas originally closer in composition to the New York one, as x-rays revealed the same posture for the hand in its earlier version. It seems likely that both Munich and St. Petersburg paintings slightly post-date the New York one and were probably painted in Italy.Xavier F. Salomon 2012",

        "Intro Description": "Lifting a languid hand to his chin, the young Van Dyck presents himself as an aristocrat, excluding any signs of his trade such as a palette and brushes. This self-portrait probably dates from the artist’s stay at the English court during the winter of 1620–21, an experience that left a lasting impact on his art and self-presentation. Shortly afterward, Van Dyck traveled to Italy, where his predilection for fine dress and aristocratic manners drew both admiration and scorn from fellow artists.",

        "Catalogue Entry": "Pierre Charles Trémolières was sent at an early age to Paris, where he entered the studio of Jean-Baptiste Van Loo (1684–1745). In 1726 he came in second in a competition which funded study at the Académie de France in Rome, and in 1728 he left for a stay of six years in Italy. Trémolières was received into the Académie in 1737 with a painting of a scene from Homer'sOdyssey. He received commissions for decorative paintings for the Hôtel de Soubise and for tapestry designs for the crown, but his health failed him and he died at the age of thirty-six.This painting ofComedyis either a study for or a later variant of a larger painting of the same subject which now belongs to the Musée d'Art et d'Histoire in Cholet, Maine-et-Loire, with its pendant,Tragedy. Both larger works belonged to Voltaire (1694–1778);Tragedyis signed and dated 1736, while its pendant representingComedyseems to have been exhibited at the Salon in 1738. Such allegories were innovative in the 1730s and in both versions ofComedyTrémolières uses props to make clear the allusion: she is depicted with a theatrical mask in her right hand, reclining on two books which, in the larger painting, are inscribed \"Molière.\"The theatrical allegory is emphasized in the larger painting by the inclusion of four marionette puppets to the left of the figure. The smaller painting was probably in the collection of the Prince de Conti (1717–1776) at the time of his death. A place in such a prestigious collection indicates the merit of the work in its own right. A study head with the same tentative smile we see here is preserved at the Nationalmuseum, Stockholm.[2013]",

The bridge has traditionally been identified as that of the town of Scey-en-Varais, located a few miles downstream from Ornans. Courbet felt a deep connection to the rugged scenery of the Franche-Comté region, taking pride in his status as an outsider in the genteel confines of Paris.",

A good number of single male portraits by Ter Borch are known; many, like this one, include a hat resting on a table.

        "Intro Description": "Although Ter Borch was born in the comparatively provincial eastern Dutch town of Zwolle and made his career at nearby Deventer after 1654, he was intimately familiar with painting in Haarlem, Amsterdam, and The Hague. He also travelled internationally before 1650, most importantly to depict members of the Dutch and Spanish courts at the peace negotiations of 1646–48 at Munster. This experience and his refined style and perception of character made ter Borch a very successful portraitist in and around Deventer. This portrait was probably painted there in the late 1650s.",

        "Notes": "Marie Dihau was a pianist and singer who often performed in Paris at the Colonne and the Lamoureux concerts. With her brother Désiré, who played the bassoon in the orchestra at the Opéra, she belonged to the music-loving circle of Degas and his father. Around 1867–68, when this portrait is thought to have been painted, she was dividing her time between Lille and Paris. She used to tell how Degas made this picture of her with her traveling bag as a consolation gift on one of her departures from Paris. It was done rapidly, its background left unfinished, in the restaurant of Mère Lefebvre in the rue de la Tour d'Auvergne. A few years later Degas painted her again, seated at the piano (Musée d'Orsay, Paris). After the war in 1870 Mlle Dihau settled in Paris with her brother Désiré and it was at their house that Toulouse-Lautrec, their cousin, was introduced to Degas. In 1890 he too painted her portrait at the piano (Musée d'Albi).",
        "Loan Restrictions": "This work may not be lent.",
        "Intro Description": "Marie Dihau was a successful pianist and singer who lived in Lille but often came to Paris to perform. She recalled that Degas executed this portrait quickly at a restaurant. Shown in sharp profile, wedged between the remnants of a finished meal and a carpetbag, the sitter—a traveling musician whom Degas typically caught on the run—effectively makes a cameo appearance in this compelling character study.Her brother Désiré, a bassoonist for the Paris Opéra, is the second figure from the left in Degas’sThe Ballet from \"Robert le Diable\"(29.100.552).",

        "Intro Description": "This charming panel is probably from the framework of a large altarpiece. Its author was active in Ravenna, but both Francesco and his brother Bernardino were much influenced by the Ferrarese painter Erocole de' Roberti and the Bolognese painter Lorenzo Costa. This work dates to around 1500.A native of Syracuse, Saint Lucy was martyred under the Roman emperor Diocletian in 303. She is much venerated and is traditionally prayed to for eye ailments.",
